Most of the fields in this file are quite straight forward: author, version number, and a short package description. When you call `library(help=\"<package name>\")` for  package `<package name>` you can see the contents of the `DESCRIPTION` file for that package (and some parts of the `NAMESPACE` file).\n\nRead through Colin Fay's (short) book on [Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/)\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the following questions: \n\n### Under what license does R operate? What is the license for ggplot2?\n\nR is licensed as GNU General Public License. R as a package is licensed under GPL-2 | GPL-3. The ggplot2 license is MIT + file LICENSE. \n\n\n### What are the dependencies of the package you made?\n\nlibrary(lubridate, quietly = TRUE)   GPL (>= 2)\nlibrary(tabulizer)    MIT + file LICENSE\nlibrary(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE)   MIT + file LICENSE\nlibrary(stringr)  MIT + file LICENSE\n\nAre packages we used. \n\nUnder which license should this blog post be published? Make sure that you are using an appropriate license. \nI would use MIT + file LICENSE because it does not matter if someone modifies anything. \n\n### Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\n\nI would say yes you can publish a package on CRAN under an MIT license but it might not be technically following the rules. \n\nThe 'harping' questions:\n\n- Is it legal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\nNo?\n- Is it illegal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\nNo?\n- Is it a copyright infringement to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\nYes\n- Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 without infringing copyright?\nNo\n\nThe licensing was a little confusing. It almost sounds like it isn't very explicitly defined so it isn't legal, but also not illegal. I'm not sure I understood the licensing very well. \n\n",
