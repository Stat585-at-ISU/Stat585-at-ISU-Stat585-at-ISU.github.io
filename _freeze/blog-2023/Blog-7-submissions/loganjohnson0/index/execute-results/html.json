Most of the fields in this file are quite straight forward: author, version number, and a short package description. When you call `library(help=\"<package name>\")` for  package `<package name>` you can see the contents of the `DESCRIPTION` file for that package (and some parts of the `NAMESPACE` file).\n\nRead through Colin Fay's (short) book on [Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/)\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the following questions: \n\n### Under what license does R operate? What is the license for ggplot2?\n\n### My Responses:\n\n#### R\n\nR operates under a multitude of licenses, including either the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2 or Version 3. R also states that a few files are distributed under the LESSER GNU GPL, version 2.1 or later. \n\n#### ggplot2\n\n`ggplot2` operates under an MIT + file license. \n\n### What are the dependencies of the package you made?\n\nRead through [chapter 5.2 of Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/practical.html#dependencies-exploration). Combine and adjust the code pieces to create the dependencies for a package that is on github rather than CRAN. (Don't forget about the package `desc`.) What dependencies does the package have that you created for Lab-3? \nWhich licenses are involved? \nAre all of these dependencies required? Elaborate.\n\nUnder which license should this blog post be published? Make sure that you are using an appropriate license. (You can change the current licenses with the help of commands from the `use_license_XXX` family in the `usethis` package)\n\n### My Responses:\n\n• I looked at the `emo` package and compared it with `ggplot2`. `emo` is hosted on github while `ggplot2` has CRAN listed as the repository. The `ggplot2` package has a different license than the `emo` package, listed under the MIT + file license or GPL-3 licenses, respectively. \n\n• Without explicitly adding to the dependencies part of the package, each new package includes the dependency of R (>= 2.10). This is true of the package made during Lab 3. There is an MIT + file license for the new package that we created. Since each of the packages are considered \"add-on\" or \"extensions\" of R, and R is licensed under a GPL-2 or GPL-3 license, each of the \"add-on\" or packages developed have to be licensed under a GPL-compatible license. This blog post could or should be licensed under a `Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 United States License` because it requires attribution while restricting commercial use or derivative work.\n\n### Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\n\nWhen confronted with the above question, ChatGPT gave two -- quite different -- responses, as shown below. \nThe main point in both responses is 'your package may be considered  derivative work'. At the specific problem of the package developed for Lab 3, what is your opinion about potential copyright infringements when releasing the package with an MIT license? Make sure to take the relevant passage in Colin Fay's book under consideration.\n\n### My Responses:\n•This is a tricky questions. Our package in Lab 3 includes data that we did not create. This data is publicly available, but since it is accessing the data, it would be best to have the user of the package acknowledge the license or the initial location of the public data, similar to the example that was used with the `textdata` and `tinytex` examples in the book. If the user were to use the get_pd_presslog function from our package, the user could be prompted with a message on the license about the data.\n\n•I think the legality of the MIT license having a dependency on the GPL-3 license is kind of a gray area. It might depend on the type of data or information under the GPL-3 license. Conversely, my knowledge of the legality of these licenses could be completely the opposite where it is illegal to do this but because of the populations poor understanding of this and the lack of control or enforcement by the GPL-3 license holders, this type of violation continues to pass through the system.\n\n```\nThe legal implications of publishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 are complex and can vary depending on the specific circumstances. It is always advisable to seek legal advice from a licensed attorney if you have any doubts or concerns about licensing issues.\n\nHowever, in general, it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3. This is because the MIT license is a permissive open-source license that allows for more flexibility in how the software can be used and distributed, and it is generally considered compatible with the GPL-3 license.\n\nThat being said, if your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore subject to the terms of the GPL-3 license. This means that if you distribute your package, you may need to also distribute the source code for your package under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license, and you may need to ensure that the requirements of the GPL-3 license are met for the entire distribution, including any dependencies.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the R community has its own guidelines and recommendations for package licensing, and it is important to comply with these guidelines if you want to publish your package on CRAN. The CRAN Repository Policy states that packages should have a \"permissive\" or \"GPL-compatible\" license, but does not explicitly require that packages use the GPL license or any other specific license.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, it is important to understand the implications of the different licenses and to ensure that you comply with any applicable guidelines and recommendations from the R community.\n```\n\nAfter harping a bit on copyright infringement in general, ChatGPT changed its response to\n\n```\nTechnically, you can publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, but doing so would not be compliant with the terms of the GPL-3 license.\n\nThe GPL-3 license is a strong copyleft license that requires derivative works to be released under the same license. If your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore must be licensed under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license.\n\nThe MIT license, on the other hand, is a permissive license that allows for more flexibility in how the software is used and distributed. However, it is not compatible with the GPL-3 license, and therefore cannot be used for derivative works of GPL-3-licensed software.\n\nPublishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 would be a licensing violation, and could potentially result in legal action or other consequences. It is important to comply with the licensing requirements of all dependencies in your package to avoid any legal issues.\n```\n\nThe 'harping' questions:\n\n- Is it legal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\n\n- Is it illegal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\n\n- Is it a copyright infringement to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\n\n- Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 without infringing copyright?\n\n\n## Submission\n\nWrite answers to the questions directly into the file `README.Rmd`.
