CC0 ensures open access to all the creative work such as written pieces, painting, and music, among others. Open access means that the creator has waived all copyright on their work, allowing users to modify, re-create and distribute it without any restriction. However, as CC0 is termed as a public domain dedication, it is outside the purview of the regular open-source licenses such as GPL and MIT.\n\nMake sure that you are using an appropriate license. (You can change the current licenses with the help of commands from the `use_license_XXX` family in the `usethis` package)\n\n### Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\n\nWhen confronted with the above question, ChatGPT gave two -- quite different -- responses, as shown below. \nThe main point in both responses is 'your package may be considered  derivative work'. At the specific problem of the package developed for Lab 3, what is your opinion about potential copyright infringements when releasing the package with an MIT license? Make sure to take the relevant passage in Colin Fay's book under consideration.\n\n```\nThe legal implications of publishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 are complex and can vary depending on the specific circumstances. It is always advisable to seek legal advice from a licensed attorney if you have any doubts or concerns about licensing issues.\n\nHowever, in general, it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3. This is because the MIT license is a permissive open-source license that allows for more flexibility in how the software can be used and distributed, and it is generally considered compatible with the GPL-3 license.\n\nThat being said, if your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore subject to the terms of the GPL-3 license. This means that if you distribute your package, you may need to also distribute the source code for your package under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license, and you may need to ensure that the requirements of the GPL-3 license are met for the entire distribution, including any dependencies.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the R community has its own guidelines and recommendations for package licensing, and it is important to comply with these guidelines if you want to publish your package on CRAN. The CRAN Repository Policy states that packages should have a \"permissive\" or \"GPL-compatible\" license, but does not explicitly require that packages use the GPL license or any other specific license.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, it is important to understand the implications of the different licenses and to ensure that you comply with any applicable guidelines and recommendations from the R community.\n```\n\nAfter harping a bit on copyright infringement in general, ChatGPT changed its response to\n\n```\nTechnically, you can publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, but doing so would not be compliant with the terms of the GPL-3 license.\n\nThe GPL-3 license is a strong copyleft license that requires derivative works to be released under the same license. If your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore must be licensed under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license.\n\nThe MIT license, on the other hand, is a permissive license that allows for more flexibility in how the software is used and distributed. However, it is not compatible with the GPL-3 license, and therefore cannot be used for derivative works of GPL-3-licensed software.\n\nPublishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 would be a licensing violation, and could potentially result in legal action or other consequences. It is important to comply with the licensing requirements of all dependencies in your package to avoid any legal issues.\n```\n\nThe 'harping' questions:\n\n- Is it legal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\n\n- Is it illegal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\n\n- Is it a copyright infringement to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?\n\n- Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 without infringing copyright?\n\n#summary of all the above  questions\n\n\nHere’s a common answer to all the “harping” questions. According to the book, it is legal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3. However, there are certain considerations that one needs to be aware of. First of all, the MIT license is permissible license, which means that it has no restrictions on the use, modification, and distribution of the software. On the other hand, the GPT-3 license is a copyleft license which requires that any software distributed is also licensed under GPT-3.Considering these requirements, even if a code under a permissible license such as MIT combined with one that uses a GPT-3 license, it must meet the requisites of the stricter GPT-3 license. \n\n\n\n## Submission\n\nWrite answers to the questions directly into the file `README.Rmd`.
