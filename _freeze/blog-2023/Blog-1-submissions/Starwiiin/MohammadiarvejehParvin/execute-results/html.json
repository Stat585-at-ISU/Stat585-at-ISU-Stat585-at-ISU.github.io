I picked this question, link: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75225812/how-to-identify-rows-where-observations-are-identical-in-two-different-columns-i)\n\nMy stackoverflow account name: StarWiiin\n\n\n\nIn the following R chunk, I prepared my solution with code:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a data including two columns: start_id, end_id\n\nstart_id = c(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\", \"seven\")\nend_id = c(\"one\", \"three\", \"two\", \"four\", \"seven\", \"six\", \"five\")\n\n\ndf = data.frame(start_id, end_id)\ndf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  start_id end_id\n1      one    one\n2      two  three\n3    three    two\n4     four   four\n5     five  seven\n6      six    six\n7    seven   five\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# create a new column which is True if start_id equals end_id, otherwise it is False.\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf = df %>% \n  mutate(status= if_else(.$start_id == .$end_id, 'True', 'False'))\ndf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  start_id end_id status\n1      one    one   True\n2      two  three  False\n3    three    two  False\n4     four   four   True\n5     five  seven  False\n6      six    six   True\n7    seven   five  False\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n3. I tried to answer breifly but comprehensive. Since the question was related to R, I created a dataframe based on the writer explanations and I gave the solution exactly by solving the example. Also, I got the output myseld and I checked it to be sure it is true. So, my solution is easily reproducible and verified. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
