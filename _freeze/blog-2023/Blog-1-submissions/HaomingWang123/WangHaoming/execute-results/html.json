I typed \"r\" and \"plot\" because this is something that I have some knowledge of and I might be able to answer some questions about plotting in R. Then, I located the question that I answered above which is a relatively easy question. By reading the title of this question, I could easily get what they want to know, and based on my knowledge of R and ggplot2 package, it is easy for me to come up with an illustration that used ggplot() and geom_line() to plot multiple lines in the same plot. After I finished my solution, I came back to the stackoverflow page and read through others' solutions. It turned out that there are many different ways of drawing two graphs in the same plot that I have not used before. Their ideas really helped me and provided me with more tools in my future R experience.\n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.\n",
