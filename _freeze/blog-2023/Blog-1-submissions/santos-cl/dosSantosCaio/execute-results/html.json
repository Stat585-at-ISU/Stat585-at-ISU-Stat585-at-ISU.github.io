The idea was to apply a function rowwise which returned the distance from the hospital to the home location of each patient.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- data.frame(major_city = c(\"Mountain View\",\"Watsonville\", \"Honolulu\", \"Los Altos\", \"Morgan Hill\", \"Fulton\", \"Oak Grove\", \"Port Kent\", \"Bedford\", \"San Jose\"),\n                 latitude = c(37.39, 36.9, 21.31, 37.36, 37.1, 43.3, 36.69, 44.526, NA, 37.27),\n                 longitude = c(-122.07, -121.7, -157.85, -122.15, -121.7, -76.4, -87.44, -73.409, NA, -121.84))\n\ndf$distance_m <- apply(df, MARGIN = 1, function(x) {\n  geosphere::distGeo(as.numeric(c(x['longitude'], x['latitude'])),\n                     c(-119.85, 36.84)) \n  })\n\ndf$distance_km <- df$distance_m / 1000\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe ouput provided the distance for all rows in the data frame\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n      major_city latitude longitude distance_m distance_km\n1  Mountain View   37.390  -122.070   206527.4    206.5274\n2    Watsonville   36.900  -121.700   165083.2    165.0832\n3       Honolulu   21.310  -157.850  4045683.3   4045.6833\n4      Los Altos   37.360  -122.150   212440.1    212.4401\n5    Morgan Hill   37.100  -121.700   167241.2    167.2412\n6         Fulton   43.300   -76.400  3731976.3   3731.9763\n7      Oak Grove   36.690   -87.440  2879678.0   2879.6780\n8      Port Kent   44.526   -73.409  3962114.4   3962.1144\n9        Bedford       NA        NA         NA          NA\n10      San Jose   37.270  -121.840   183321.3    183.3213\n```\n:::\n\n\n## MY EXPERIENCE\n\nThis was my first time answering questions on Stack Overflow. This question in specific was good because the poster provided a minimal reproducible example. When I was looking for questions to answer, I saw several questions that could not be answered because they did not provide examples. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, being able to provide answers to a community that has greatly helped me when I taking my first steps towards learning R.\n",
