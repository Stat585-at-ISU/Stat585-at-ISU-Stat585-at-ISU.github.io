Like, I'm not sure if the user looked elsewhere before asking on StackOverflow. Simply Googling \"How to remove the numbering before a section in LaTeX\" pulls up an Overleaf site with the answer. So if I were that person, I would have first looked elsewhere. \n  - The question asker also could have done a little better with include all relevant code in order to answer their solution. They included just the part that was giving them trouble, when a document class and some of the packages being used would have been helpful. I assumed they were working on an article as it is the most common, but the answer should apply across all classes.\n  - If I could talk to them face-to-face, I would have pointed them to other sources (i.e. Overleaf) for most of their questions, since their documentation is really good for quick-access LaTeX questions. If they were also working in somehting like R with a Quarto document, I know Quarto's website also has a plethora of knowledge.\n  - One thing the readings did not tell you is that answering on StackOverflow is **SO SCARY** like I haven't been as stressed out about anything before. Like, what is too little to add? Is saying that ```{python}`` ` (without the space) is another way to quickly access Python in a .Rmd document, when someone already spoke about the code you can run in a R session with the 'reticulate' package? Also I was and still am afraid that I made a mistake with my answer and it is wrong or not what they needed and then my answer will get down-voted to the deepest depths.\n  - I'm just too timid to ask questions on StackOverflow, but also too timid to answer them.\n \n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.\n",
