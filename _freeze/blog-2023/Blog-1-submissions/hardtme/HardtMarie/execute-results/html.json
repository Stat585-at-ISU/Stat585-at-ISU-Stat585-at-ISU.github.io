It was very helpful that the OP provided their code with the question. However, the OP's code used a dataset that was not built into R and the OP did not include code to create the dataset for the plot. This broke one of the guidelines for minimal reproducible examples. Fortunately, the requested plot was simple enough that I could recreate the issue using the built-in `iris` dataset in R. The problem turned out to be that the OP wanted to use the `fill` aesthetic to change the color of the bars on the plot via `scale_fill_manual` but did not have anything mapped to the `fill` aesthetic. In my answer, I provided an example very similar to the OP's code, except I used the `iris` dataset with the variable `Species` mapped to the `x` aesthetic to define the bars and also mapped `Species` to the `fill` aesthetic so I could use `scale_fill_manual` to change the colors of the bars.\n",
