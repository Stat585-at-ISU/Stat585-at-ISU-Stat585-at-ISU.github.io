A lot of the people were following the rules as described in the reading. However, there were some which were not following and posting the minimal reproducible example or researching the questions if they were already answered.\n\nI learned another thing during this assignment. I created the account recently and I was not allowed to comment if I do not have more than 50 reputation on the stackoverflow. Which seems like a good system for preventing the new fake/spam accounts. Stackoverflow seems like a helpful community to ask questions. There were other highly active questions which I was not allowed to answer due to similar reason as having a low reputation.\n\nThe second question I answered was on python as we discussed in the class. Python community seems way larger than the R community and more developed. However, the questions seemed more organized and following the guidelines of the stackoverflow to ask a good question.\n \n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.\n",
