In this case, the author needed to get data from a wide format into a long format. The author provided code for the process, but did not include code for a sample dataset. This did not allow me to fully test to see if my solution worked, but the problem was within the syntax. The author was inputting a list of countries to melt with reshape2 and was missing a couple of commas. The error could be reproduced with `c(\"Var1\" \"Var2)`. I also provided a recommendation to use the `pivot_longer()` function to simplify the amount of typing (and potential typing errors).\n\n- Minimal: the code provide was quite basic, but included all columns necessary for their particular problem. However, this was actually needed in this case to solve their problem.\n\n- Complete: author did not provide the dataset, so I could not reproduce the problem directly\n\n- Reproducible: a similar syntax error gave the same result on my computer, so the problem was reproducible with my suspicion of the problem.\n \n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.\n",
