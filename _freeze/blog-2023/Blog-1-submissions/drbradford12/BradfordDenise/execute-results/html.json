As chapter 10 may have been the starting place, suggesting Chapter 15 was at an attempt to allow the user to understand more about the UI being reactive when changed. Or in the event that the UI is not what they were actually looking for in their response to their question.\n\nPros:\n- The person asked a question that was important and specific to Shiny. \n- The person knows enough to be detailed in the outcome\n\nCons:\n- The person who posted the question failed to ask a question that was specific with an example. As a result, it would be hard to make the best recommendation.\n- We don't know what the data look like\n\n\n",
