In the first question I answered, the code included in the question is reproducible, which make it easier for me to find out the solution. In the second question, there isn't an example dataset in the question. Though I am able to reproduce his shiny app, but I need to generate a dataset myself.\n- You may able to solve your problem by some searchings. One question I answered is how to change the column width of table in shiny app. Similar questions have been answered before. But there are multiple issues needed to be fixed. So the question may not be fixed by one searching. Actually several different related questions need to be searched to solve the problem.\n- The questions I answered both have a clear title and a clear description about their problems. It's easy for me to determine whether I could help by looking at the title and glancing at the first few lines of the questions.\n",
