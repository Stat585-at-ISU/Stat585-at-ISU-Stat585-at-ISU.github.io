I also appreciated the informative titles of questions. Both helped me quickly assess if a question was something I could solve using my own experience and made me want to answer their questions more, making clear to me why the readings have such guidelines for posting questions.\n\nThe question I chose to answer was relatively simple with only 6 lines of code.  However, when trying to answer their question, I realized that their example was not reproducible for others because they didn't include a dataset that corresponded to their variable in the code. I ended up creating my own little example to try to understand what their issue was. In doing so, I also realized that, as the readings said, making a minimal reproducible example isn't always that hard and that trying to make one can help you think through your bug as well.\n\n\n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.\n",
