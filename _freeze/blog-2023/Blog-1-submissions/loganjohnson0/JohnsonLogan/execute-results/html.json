The link to the post is included [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75253491/how-do-i-plot-a-scatterplot-graph-with-a-repeated-measures-variable-and-a-contin/75254525#75254525). The question did not provide an example of their data or any code they had been working with. \n\n3. **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading. **\n\nIn reading the examples of asking a good question on stackoverflow and the other links provided, it is clear that you must include a sufficient amount of background on the question you are asking. This can be an overview of the question you have, some example of the data, and some of the code that you have been using. In the example that I had, there was none of this. The person had 3 sentences and vagely described their problem. I did my best to answer their question, provide a link to ggplot2 cheat sheets, and provide some potential examples. \n \n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.",
