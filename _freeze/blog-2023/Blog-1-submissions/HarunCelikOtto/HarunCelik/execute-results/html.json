The question I answered was [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75240637/using-a-list-of-variables-in-a-loop/75241256#75241256) about using a list of variables in a loop in R. My username is HarunCelikOtto and is chronologically the second answer to the question. \n\nI think that after reading the advice by Stack Overflow's \"How do I ask a good question?\" I came to better understand why I had trouble understanding the question that the user posted on the forum. While the inquirer added some example code about what data they were working with, they didn't elaborate on the outcome that was expected of the corrected code. For this reason, another user and myself had to assume what the intended output had to be. While the user may find my answer helpful, maybe it isn't exactly the result that they want because the objective was unclear. Looking through questions, I've come to the realization after this activity that only a good question can elicit a good response.\n",
