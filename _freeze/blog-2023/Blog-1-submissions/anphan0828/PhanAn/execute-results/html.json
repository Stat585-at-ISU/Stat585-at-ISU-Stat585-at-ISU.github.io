The author was having trouble with conditionally filling his/her new column in a dataframe. He/she used an anonymous function (lambda) to add values as desired. \n\n2. **Document which question you answered (link to your answer).**\nLink to [my answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75252644/21088924)\n\n3. **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading. **\n\nThe question was straightforward and details of the output were described in many scenarios. It \"includes just enough code to allow others to reproduce the problem\" (as posted in the 'minimal complete verifiable example' guide). Because of that, I guessed that they accidentally assign values to the same cell in the dataframe, which seemed suspicious.\n\nI thought that the conditions should be structured in an if-elif-else instead of two separate if-else commands. I double checked the correct if-elif-else structure of an anonymous function and found a StackOverflow post on that. Next, I tried to explain the issue he/she was having and propose a solution as well as the link to the original answer on StackOverflow. Eventually, I rewrote the code in his/her context to make sure they understand my point.\n\nIt was my first time ever answering a StackOverflow question. I am not sure if the author figured it out yet (there was no update up to when I submitted this homework) but I feel good for being a part of an awesome community that helped me a lot during my first year. Thank you for the meaningful homework!\n\n\n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.\n",
