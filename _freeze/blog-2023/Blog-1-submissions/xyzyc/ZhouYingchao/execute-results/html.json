Here is the link: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75228497/how-can-i-plot-a-map-using-ggplot2-that-includes-the-latitude-and-longitude-of-t/75229784#75229784](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75228497/how-can-i-plot-a-map-using-ggplot2-that-includes-the-latitude-and-longitude-of-t/75229784#75229784)\n\n3. **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading. **  \n\nome questions I see on stackoverflow are long and messy, with many code chunks and I feel hard to read and understand them. Although the titles seem not too difficult, after clicking in, I gave up reading them. Giving a minimal reproducible example can really make it much easier for answerers.  \n\n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.\n",
