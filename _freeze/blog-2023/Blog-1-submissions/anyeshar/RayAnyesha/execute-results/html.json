While the question was on topic and had an appropriate title, it was not researched and not reproducible. The question was about merging two csv files, and I am sure that question has already been asked before. Also, they gave a description of the data, but it was not very detailed. I answered the question based on what I assumed the data looked like, but the question could have been more descriptive. From looking around on Stack Exchange, it is more difficult than you think to ask a good question. \n\n\n\n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.\n",
