To be able to add to that initial figure you can use the lines() function or the points() to add any addition data information to that plot.\n\nGiven your data, you could use the following code to accomplish your task.\n\n`{r}\nx  <- seq(-2, 2, 0.05)\ny1 <- pnorm(x)\ny2 <- pnorm(x, 1, 1)\nplot(x, y1, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\nplot(x, y2, type = \"l\", col = \"green\")\n\n\nplot(x, y1, type = \"l\", col = \"red\") +\nlines(x, y2, type = \"l\", col = \"green\")\n```\nThis will produce the following figure. \n\n<img width=\"1031\" alt=\"Solution\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100876336/214467489-4c7af004-e517-4576-84ee-10448abe476f.png\">\n\n3. **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading. **\n\nFrom the Stack Overflow 'How do I ask a good question?', it discussed how it is easier to provide answers to questions when they are summarized, specific, and reproducible. Because of this, I kpet these in mind when searching for questions to answer. I found a question that was to the point in what they needed to accomplish and provided simple data to work with as an example. Following the advice from Stack overflow 'How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example' I started from scratch on my own device and broke the question into simple, traceable steps. \n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\nInstructions to follow.\n",
