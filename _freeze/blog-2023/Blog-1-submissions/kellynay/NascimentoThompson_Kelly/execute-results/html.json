He provided some ways he tried to solve the problem with methods applied, but \n I can not tell if he imported the correct packages to run the code or what the output \n would of his problem will look like due to the lack of example code.\n \n His question seemed easy to find an answer online, thus, some \"Search and Research\"could\n have easily solved his problem. I found an article discussing his problem and linked it\n in my answer.\n\n<!--Go to [https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog) for instructions about how to prepare and submit your blog post.-->\n<!--Instructions to follow.-->\n",
