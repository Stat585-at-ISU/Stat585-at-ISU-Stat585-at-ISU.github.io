All too often papers have to be retracted for unintended reasons. [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) is a data base that keeps track of retracted papers (see the related [Science magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty) publication). \n\nRead the paper [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) by Sandve et al.\n\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the questions: \n\n1. Pick one of the papers from Retraction Watch that were retracted because of errors in the paper (you might want to pick a paper from the set of featured papers, because there are usually more details available). Describe what went wrong. Would any of the rules by Sandve et al. have helped in this situation?\n\nThe article 'Inhaled Nitric Oxide Protects Cerebral Autoregulation and Reduces Hippocampal Necrosis After Traumatic Brain Injury Through Inhibition of ET-1, ERK MAPK and IL-6 Upregulation in Pigs' has been retracted. This article has problems with duplicated plots, identical data found in an earlier publication, unclear descriptions of the experiment conducted, and unmatched data of animals reported with the surgical records.\n\nThe entire retraction details are as followed:\n\n*The Editor-in-Chief has retracted this article on the request of William M. Armstead. An institutional investigation by the University of Pennsylvania found that images in Figures 6A, B, C, E and F duplicate, without attribution, images in earlier publications that reported on different experiments; numerical data, presented in the histogram of Figure 6G, appeared identical to data found in earlier publications [1, 2]. The University notes that the authors were unable to provide raw data supporting the results for Figure 6G; the methodology section of the article did not accurately describe the conduct of the reported experiment; and the number, age or treatment condition of the animals reported did not match the surgical records.*\n\n*Victor Curvello and William M. Amrstead agree to this retraction. Philip Pastor and Monica S. Vavilala have not responded to any correspondence from the editor or publisher about this retraction.*\n\nThe following rules might help:\n\n* Rule 7: Always Store Raw Data behind Plots. It might help if they can raw data supporting the results for Figure 6G.\n\n* Rule 9: Connect Textual Statements to Underlying Results. It might help if they have textual statements for all figures allowing peers to make their own assessment of the claims they make.\n\n* Rule 10: Provide Public Access to Scripts, Runs, and Results.\n\n2. After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not (be able to) follow in your future projects.\n\nRule 1 is most important to me, but I think Rule 1 is closely related to other rules. Simulations and applications usually are important parts of my research. For simulations, the setting of parameters is essential, and sometimes random seeds (related to Rule 6) might also be needed to reproduce the results that support the conclusion. For applications, the accessibility of original data is important for reproducible results. So providing public access to the input data and code like stating in Rule 10 is also important. And many cleaning steps might be needed for the raw data in the application, so keep track of all details is a golden rule to follow.\n\nI think Rule 8 is hard to follow. Even though it is essential to check the data behind the summarized results, it is hard for the co-authors and readers to generalize useful information from these data. So I think storing raw data behind the plots for reproducing as suggested in Rule 7 or connecting textual statements to underlying results as suggested in Rule 9 is more useful. We might do this for self check, but a hypertext as suggested in this rule seems unnecessary to me.\n\n\n<!-- ## Submission -->\n\n<!-- 1. Push your changes to your repository.  -->\n\n<!-- 2. You are ready to call it good, once all your github actions pass without an error. You can check on that by selecting 'Actions' on the menu and ensure that the last item has a green checkmark. The action for this repository checks the yaml of your contribution for the existence of the author name, a title, date and categories.
