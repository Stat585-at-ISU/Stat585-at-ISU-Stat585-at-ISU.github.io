All too often papers have to be retracted for unintended reasons. [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) is a data base that keeps track of retracted papers (see the related [Science magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty) publication). \n\nRead the paper [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) by Sandve et al.\n\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the questions: \n\n1. Pick one of the papers from Retraction Watch that were retracted because of errors in the paper (you might want to pick a paper from the set of featured papers, because there are usually more details available). Describe what went wrong. Would any of the rules by Sandve et al. have helped in this situation?\n\nFrom the retraction watch, I picked the paper \"Selective killing of cancer cells by a small molecule targeting the stress response to ROS\" The retraction reason was the unavailability of original data for the figures. I was surprised that it was still published in the \"nature\" journal.\n\nThe rules by Sandve et al. will defintely help in this situation. Specially the Data related rules which this paper had mistakes in. Rule 2, Rule 5, and Rule 7 would have been the best thing to do for this paper.\n\n\n2. After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not (be able to) follow in your future projects.\n\nI will most likely to follow Rule 4 which is version control. I did not know about how good the git version control is and after learning it in the class I am more likely to follow it and even like to have versions of my code.\n\nThe rule which might be hardest to follow for me is Rule 5, keeping track of intermediate results. We generate tons of data in my lab. Not everything is useful and some of the results are just useless. Keeping track of them takes time which could be better utilized in storing only the successful results. However, I will try to find a way to do this efficiently and make a process where I could dump all the data in cybox folder quickly.\n\n## Submission\n\n1. Push your changes to your repository. \n\n2. You are ready to call it good, once all your github actions pass without an error. You can check on that by selecting 'Actions' on the menu and ensure that the last item has a green checkmark. The action for this repository checks the yaml of your contribution for the existence of the author name, a title, date and categories. Don't forget the space after the colon!\nOnce the action passes, the badge along the top will also change its color accordingly. \nAs of right now, the status for the YAML front matter is:\n\n![Frontmatter check](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/blog-5-charchit/actions/workflows/check-yaml.yaml/badge.svg)\n\n\n```\n---\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ntitle: \"Specify your title\"\ndate: \"2023-02-23\"\ncategories: \"Ethics and Reproducibility...\"\n---\n```\n\n\n\n",
