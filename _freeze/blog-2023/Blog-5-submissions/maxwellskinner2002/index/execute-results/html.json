All too often papers have to be retracted for unintended reasons. [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) is a data base that keeps track of retracted papers (see the related [Science magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty) publication). \n\nRead the paper [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) by Sandve et al.\n\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the questions: \n\n1. Pick one of the papers from Retraction Watch that were retracted because of errors in the paper (you might want to pick a paper from the set of featured papers, because there are usually more details available). Describe what went wrong. Would any of the rules by Sandve et al. have helped in this situation?\n\nAnswer: From the Retraction Watch database, there contained an article titled Facial expressions can detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease: preliminary evidence from videos collected online. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00502-8 . It was retracted because of the authors used a data pre-processing tool which resulted in an information leak from train to test samples. This made it so there were incorrect classification metrics. \n\nFollowing some of the rules by Sandve et all, I believe this mistake could have been avoided or at least mitigated. Much of the data manipulation was done manually through individual lines of code rather than through a more robust method like something from the sklearn package in Python. Looking at the code for their clustering analysis, they split the train and test sets manually rather than through a sklearn train, test, split method. This possibly led to the train and test sets being bled together, leading to inaccurate results. \n\n\n2. After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not (be able to) follow in your future projects.\n\nSome of the most useful rules I personally will start using is rule 10. After reading over multiple papers involving data science topics, I didn't know before that the scripts used in the paper were so readily available. I always knew Github could be used to store results and all of the methods used, but I didn't know it was becoming the standard. In doing research in the future, I will make sure to document cleanly and publish all of my work in a github repo so my results can be replicated as accurately as possible.\n\nOne of the rules that will be the hardest to follow is rule 6. In projects containing a level of randomness, to be able to reproduce results, you have to have the same seed used in the experiment. One example I would think of that would make things difficult to replicate would be the train and test splits, making sure those are exact and completely reproducible. While with a proper statistical analysis, randomly splitting the test and train sets should be yielding similar results regardless of the split, it is still difficult to make it exact and reproducible for that kind of case. \n\n\n## Submission\n\n1. Push your changes to your repository. \n\n2. You are ready to call it good, once all your github actions pass without an error. You can check on that by selecting 'Actions' on the menu and ensure that the last item has a green checkmark. The action for this repository checks the yaml of your contribution for the existence of the author name, a title, date and categories. Don't forget the space after the colon!\nOnce the action passes, the badge along the top will also change its color accordingly. \nAs of right now, the status for the YAML front matter is:\n\n![Frontmatter check](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/Blog-5/actions/workflows/check-yaml.yaml/badge.svg)\n\n\n```\n---\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ntitle: \"Specify your title\"\ndate: \"2023-02-23\"\ncategories: \"Ethics and Reproducibility...\"\n---\n```\n\n\n\n",
