All too often papers have to be retracted for unintended reasons. [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) is a data base that keeps track of retracted papers (see the related [Science magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty) publication). \n\nRead the paper [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) by Sandve et al.\n\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the questions: \n\n1. Pick one of the papers from Retraction Watch that were retracted because of errors in the paper (you might want to pick a paper from the set of featured papers, because there are usually more details available). Describe what went wrong. Would any of the rules by Sandve et al. have helped in this situation?\n\n2. After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not (be able to) follow in your future projects.\n\n## Submission\n\n1. Push your changes to your repository. \n\n2. You are ready to call it good, once all your github actions pass without an error. You can check on that by selecting 'Actions' on the menu and ensure that the last item has a green checkmark. The action for this repository checks the yaml of your contribution for the existence of the author name, a title, date and categories. Don't forget the space after the colon!\nOnce the action passes, the badge along the top will also change its color accordingly. \nAs of right now, the status for the YAML front matter is:\n\n![Frontmatter check](https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/Blog-5/actions/workflows/check-yaml.yaml/badge.svg)\n\n\n```\n---\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ntitle: \"Specify your title\"\ndate: \"2023-02-23\"\ncategories: \"Ethics and Reproducibility...\"\n---\n```\n\n\n\n",
