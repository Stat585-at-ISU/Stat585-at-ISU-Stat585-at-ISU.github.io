All too often papers have to be retracted for unintended reasons. [Retraction Watch](https://retractionwatch.com/) is a data base that keeps track of retracted papers (see the related [Science magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty) publication). \n\nRead the paper [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285) by Sandve et al.\n\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the questions: \n\n1. Pick one of the papers from Retraction Watch that were retracted because of errors in the paper (you might want to pick a paper from the set of featured papers, because there are usually more details available). Describe what went wrong. Would any of the rules by Sandve et al. have helped in this situation?\n\nI chose the paper \"Synthetic lethality of combined glutaminase and Hsp90 inhibition in mTORC1-driven tumor cells,\" as described in this [Retraction Watch article](https://retractionwatch.com/2023/02/01/former-harvard-researchers-lose-pnas-paper-for-reusing-data/#more-126484). In this paper, the authors presented the same data in multiple figures without noting that they did so. This situation might have been avoided if the authors had followed Sandve et al.'s rule 7: always store raw data behind plots. If the authors knew the particular figures that went with all of the data they wanted to plot, they could have ensured that all of their figures showed all of the appropriate data without duplication. However, John Blenis, the paper's corresponding author, has had corrections issued for earlier papers due to data omission and data duplication issues. This makes me wonder if the data duplication in the figures was not an innocent mistake that could have been fixed by following Sandve et al.'s rules.\n\n2. After reading the paper by Sandve et al. describe which rule you are most likely to follow and why, and which rule you find the hardest to follow and will likely not (be able to) follow in your future projects.\n\nThe rule I find easiest to follow is rule 6: for analyses that include randomness, note underlying random seeds. Whenever I run an analysis that involves a (pseudo-)random process like drawing random numbers or running a Bayesian sampler (such as fitting `stan` models via the `rstan` package), I always seed a seed beforehand so I can get the same results back every time I run the analysis. However, it sounds like I need to do a better job of documenting which random seed I used in reports of my work.\nThe rule I find hardest to follow is rule 2: avoid manual data manipulation steps. In my work, I always save the code I use to modify data, but I typically don't try to automate the data manipulation process. (As an aside, I do not really like the term \"data manipulation\" since it sounds like we could be doing nefarious things with our data. I prefer \"data cleaning\" or \"data wrangling.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n",
