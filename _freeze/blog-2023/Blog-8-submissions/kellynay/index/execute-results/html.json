It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). \n\nposit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)\n\nDescribe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.\n\n**How did building your own website go?**\n\nBuilding the website was fun and quite easy until I had to commit and push all the files required.\nThere was a yellow question mark beside the site_libs folder and I tried clicking on it to get the check mark, so I could commit and push.\n\n\nI kept getting the following error message: \n\nAnother git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.\nan editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes\nare terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process\nmay have crashed in this repository earlier:\nremove the file manually to continue.\nUpdating 8130468..b4ecf64\n\nSo I went on my repo and added the files via upload.\nMy website has three pages: Home, Volunteering Experiences, R Favorite Packages.\n\nIn these pages I linked my student bios in different research and professional development projects that I am involved.\nI also mentioned Volunteer Experience and packages that I have enjoyed working with or packages that I see value for future work.\n\nHere is the link:\nhttps://github.com/kellynay/kellynay.github.io\n",
