It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). \n\nposit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)\n\nDescribe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.\n\n**How did building your own website go?**\n\ncreating my website with Quarto in R was actually pretty sweet! I had a lot of fun with it, and it was a smooth ride for the most part. Although, I gotta admit, I did run into some trouble with this `ERROR: YAMLException: bad indentation of a mapping entry`. But, hey, I figured it out and moved on!\n\nThe toughest part for me was figuring out what to write about myself. It's not easy to talk about yourself, you know what I mean? I spent a lot of time trying to come up with the right words, and I still don't know if I got it exactly right.\n\nI'm also obsessed with design and colors and themes, so that part was a blast. I spent way too much time trying to decide on the right colors and themes. And even then, I'm still not sure if I made the right choice! I just can't help myself.\n\nOverall, though, I really enjoyed creating my website with Quarto in R. I was so into it that I didn't even realize how much time had passed. It was a rewarding and engaging experience, and I'm thrilled with how my website turned out :)\nHere is the link: [https://motinaaa.github.io]\n",
