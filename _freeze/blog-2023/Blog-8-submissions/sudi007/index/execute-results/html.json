It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). \n\nposit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)\n\nDescribe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.\n\n**How did building your own website go?**\nFirst of all, I created a layout of the website and chose my color scheme using Quarto. Thereafter, I created the homepage and inserted an image there. Instead of a dedicated \"contact me\" page, I added icons of my social media pages and linked them. Formatting the content on this page was easy. I could play around with the different levels of the title to add structure to my content. I was also able to add bullets and other punctuation. I could add pages to my website and also select their layout. I had the option to add images on the other pages as well, although I chose to not add any. Overall, I could see the value R-studio brings in developing professional looking websites. \nHere is the link to the website :https://sudi007.github.io/\n\n\n",
