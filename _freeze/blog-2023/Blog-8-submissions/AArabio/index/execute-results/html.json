It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). \n\nposit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)\n\nDescribe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.\n\n**How did building your own website go?**\n\nThrough the process of building my website, I found that there are more complicated ways to accomplish a relatively simple task. I was able to use markdown to create a website domain that was useable and loadable... but I could not figure out how to begin the process of building a website from scratch. The site that I had created was entirely blank. By using quarto, I was able to generate the website much easier. There was already a built in template using the creation of a new project blog. From there I was able to make a few changes such as replacing the default photo with my own and altering the set up a little bit. \n\nNow that the website is up and working I am able to add posts and make changes as I continue working on new projects and taking on new adventures. I look forward to making more alterations to the website as the semester goes along to be able to make it unique to myself. \n",
