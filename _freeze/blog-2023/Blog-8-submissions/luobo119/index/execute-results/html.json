It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). \n\nposit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)\n\nDescribe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.\n\n**How did building your own website go?**\n\nWebsite Link: https://luobo119.github.io/\n\nI use Quarto to build my website. Quarto is a very powerful tool to build a website. It's very convenient to add content to the website, add links to other websites, and modify the structure of the website. I tried a sidebar navigator and it works well. Publishing the website to GitHub is a little bit confusing, but the description of the methods is detailed on Quarto website.\n",
