It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). \n\nposit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)\n\nDescribe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.\n\n**How did building your own website go?**\n\nBuilding my webiste was fun! I was able to add some photos and hace some fun with it. I for the life of me was having trouble attatching things like my CV or my email for whatever reasaon. However, following some instructions online I was able to make it about my pet! So I had some fun with it, it is pretty basic and not very interactive, but everytime I tried to add something I would get an error about certain characters not beign allowed in the column/row. And it seemed that all the answers onstack overflow or similar websites only helped that persons speciic code. I still do not know what the root porblem is .\n\nIanParzyszek.github.io/index.html\n",
