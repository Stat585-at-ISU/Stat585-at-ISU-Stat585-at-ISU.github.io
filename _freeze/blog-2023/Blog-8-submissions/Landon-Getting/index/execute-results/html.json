However, I had a few minor issues.\n\nFirst, I had trouble staging my files to be committed. I originally thought this was due to the new RStudio update. However, I reinstalled the latest RStudio version, restarted my computer, restarted my RStudio several times, and finally found success. I cannot replicate the problem so it may be tough to solve.\n\nI also had an issue where a page was not building the correctly named .html file. I developed a page called shiny.Rmd to display a Shiny App project. A file called \"Shiny.html\" is generated when the website it built. It is not recognized by the _site.yml file since it is expecting \"shiny.html\". I manually changed the file name after building to achieve success. I could not determine why this problem was occurring.\n",
