It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). \n\nposit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)\n\nDescribe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.\n\n**How did building your own website go?**\n\nParvin's answer: I made the website using simple Rmarkdown site creating \"_site.yml\", other pages, and rendering went pretty well. I had a challenge regarding the setting (main branch and docs), and pushing changes to the Github. I needed to arrange the setting and push the changes manually and it worked finally.\n",
