It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)).\n\nposit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)\n\nDescribe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.\n\n**How did building your own website go?**\n\nThis week, we were tasked with building our own website and it was an interesting task. I have been meaning to build it for sometime but it has alway been put in the back burner because other tasks took priority over it. I am glad I finally had a push to do it. Thankfully, I could count on GitHub pages to help with this task. The fact that we can upload a website the general structure to a GitHub repository and GitHub will build a webpage and deploy it, is fascinating. This removes a lot of the complications that come from bulding websites, as we often have the answer questions such as: \"Where I am going to host this?\"; \"Should I configure a database for this website?\"; and \"How do I configure a server?\".\n\nNot everything went well though, I had a hard time figuring out how to build the website using [Jeckyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I was able to find several Jeckyll templates but I failed to understand how to use them in GitHub. Eventually, I gave up on Jeckyll. I have had some previous experience building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I decided to move forward with that. Overall, I had a fun time writing about myself in a professional website. The hardest part was figuring out what should I include and what should I not. Finally, I have opted for a simple layout that communicates all the information I believe a future employer would be interested. The [website](https://santos-cl.github.io/) contains a very simple layout with the following sections:\n\n| Section            | Description                                                     |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Welcome            | Brief description of my activities nowadays.                    |\n| Profile            | Profile picture and links to social media and curriculum vitae. |\n| Research Interests | Research topics I am fascinated about.                          |\n| Education          | Universities I have attended.                                   |\n| Software           | 1 software I have published...                                  |\n| Publications       | Peer-reviewed publications                                      |\n",
