It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). \n\nposit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)\n\nDescribe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.\n\n**How did building your own website go?**\n\nDenise's Answer:\n\nTo be honest, I have had a `github pages` since last year during SDSS presentation. I've made some changes to the webpage like the landing page during this blog post. I wanted to be clear that this was some thing that I was not new to the publishing `github pages`. I would like to make more changes when I have the time.\n\n[Denise's Github Pages](https://drbradford12.github.io/)\n\nTo finally answer the question, initially, this process was MUCH EASIER than creating a blogdown website, which I also did last year. Unfortunately, I'm not great with Netlify. As a result, it has not been publicly updated and removed from all of my lines of communication.",
