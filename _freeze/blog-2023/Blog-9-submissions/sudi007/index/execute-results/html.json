These statements tell R which functions and variables from other packages are needed. In my case, I added importFrom() statements for the filter, download.file, and write.csv functions from the stats and utils packages.\n\n\nDescribe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes\n\n\nAlthough fixing the namespace issues can be challenging in R, it is an important step in developing a well-functioning and properly organized package. The goal of namespace management is to ensure that each function in your package can access the functions and the variables it needs from other packages, without polluting the global environment or causing conflicts with other packages. A key challenge I faced was to ensure that all the packages were correctly imported and defined. It was helpful that after making all the changes, there was a tool to recheck if there were any errors.  \n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\n",
