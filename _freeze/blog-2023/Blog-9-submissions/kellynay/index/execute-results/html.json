Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.\n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\n\nI worked with my Lab3 - Team 3 colleagues to fix some of the issues highlighted by Ganesh when he graded our lab assignment.\n\nExact warning message:\nWarning: replacing previous import 'dplyr::filter' by 'stats::filter' when loading 'Team3' ** testing if installed package can be loaded from final location \nWarning: replacing previous import 'dplyr::filter' by 'stats::filter' when loading 'Team3' ** testing if installed package keeps a record of temporary installation path\n\n\nThe get_presslog function was throwing a warning due to the following (Line 19 in get_presslog.R):\n\n- data_subset <- data %>% filter(Call_Received_Date >= from2) %>% filter(Call_Received_Date <= to2)\n\nWe fixed the error by doing: \n\n- data_subset <- data %>% dplyr::filter(Call_Received_Date >= from2) %>% dplyr::filter(Call_Received_Date <= to2)\n\nIn summary, we replaced 'stats::filter' by 'dplyr::filter'.\n\nWe also addressed this issue in the NAMESPACE file by writing on Line 12:\nimportFrom(\"stats\", \"filter\")\n",
