Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.\n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\n\nThe error messages that I fixed were within the Team2 package and included various import requirements in NAMESPACE and the DESCRIPTION files. To fix these issues, I added in the \"@importFrom\" component to the function to the pdf_to_tbl package for the utils and magrittr packages for the write.csv and %>% functions, respectively. I also added the libraries to the functions that were called within the R package to make more clear where each function is intended to be pulled from. I then documented these changes and loaded the package again.\n\nThere was also an issue in the pdf_to_tbl function where \".,\" as a global variable was not defined. In this instance, I simply removed the \".,\" from the pdf_to_tbl function as the data was already being piped from the area above and the \".,\" notation was not necessary.\n\nI also fixed two issues that I found when running the package. I removed the exact url from the input section of the function and instead put it at the top of the area within the section. I also changed the format of the save_as function and instead removed the \"./data/\" part of the save_as function to improve the saving of the pdf files.\n",
