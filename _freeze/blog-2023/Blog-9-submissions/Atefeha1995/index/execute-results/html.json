Please edit that file -->\n<!-- badges: start -->\n[![Frontmatter check](../../actions/workflows/check-yaml.yaml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/check-yaml.yaml)\n<!-- badges: end -->\n\n## Prompt:\n\nFix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. \n\n## Instructions:\n\nWhat we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. \n\nDescribe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.\n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\n\n**For team 4**, I ran check(\"Team4\"), and this was the result:\n\n`❯ checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE\nNamespaces in Imports field not imported from:\n  'readr' 'stringr'\nAll declared Imports should be used.`\n\n0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 1 note ✖\n\n\nSo, I changed the Imports set in Description file, and omitted 'readr' and 'stringr'.\nIt seems that these packages were not required. Here is the new result for check(\"Team4\") command:\n\n0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 0 notes ✔\n\n\n**For Team6**, When I ran document(\"Team6\"), I got this error message:\n\n`> document(\"Team6\")\nℹ Updating Team6 documentation\nℹ Loading Team6\nWarning message:\n[press_log_data.R:15] @source requires a value `\n\nThen I went to press_log_data.R file, and I checked row number 15.\nIt seems that they forgot to add an appropriate source there. So, I added the source of the data there. Then, I ran the command one more time and the problem has been solved.\n\n`> document(\"Team6\")\nℹ Updating Team6 documentation\nℹ Loading Team6\nWriting press_log_data.Rd`\n\n\nThis was the note when I ran check(\"Team6\"):\n\n`❯ checking top-level files ... NOTE\nNon-standard files/directories found at top level:\n 'presslog-20230306.csv' 'presslog_amespd_2023-03-06.pdf'`\n\n0 errors ✔ | 1 warning ✖ | 1 note ✖\n\n\nI deleted those two extra files (presslog-20230306.csv and presslog_amespd_2023-03-06.pdf), and the note has been removed.\n\n0 errors ✔ | 1 warning ✖ | 0 notes ✔\n\n\n**For Team2**, when I ran check(\"Team2\"), I got this error:\n\n`> check(\"Team2\")\nℹ Updating Team2 documentation\nℹ Loading Team2\nError: 'ames_presslog' is not an exported object from 'namespace:Team2'`\n\nI checked and found that 'ames_presslog' is not exported in namespace, and it is not in man files. So, I deleted the 'ames_presslog.R' from the R folder, and it's data from the Data folder. Then, I ran check() command again, and this was the result:\n\n 0 errors ✔ | 4 warnings ✖ | 2 notes ✖  \n  \nthis was one of the warning messages:\n\n`❯ checking Rd \\usage sections ... WARNING\nUndocumented arguments in documentation object 'get_presslog'\n'date.column'\nFunctions with \\usage entries need to have the appropriate \\alias\nentries, and all their arguments documented.\nThe \\usage entries must correspond to syntactically valid R code.\nSee chapter 'Writing R documentation files' in the 'Writing R\n Extensions' manual.`\n\n\nconsidering the message I went to the get_presslog.R file in the R folder of the Team2 package, and I added the date.column which is one of the inputs for the get_presslog function, as a parameter using the command line below.\n\n`#' @param date.column The column which contains the Date and time`\n\nI saved the changes, and checked it again. The number of warnings was reduced to 3.\n\n0 errors ✔ | 3 warnings ✖ | 2 notes ✖\n",
