Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.\n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\n\nBefore the spring break, I fixed several things for TeamUNL:\n\n- By adding `^presslog.*\\.pdf$` to the .RBuildignore file, the `check` function will ignore the pdf files in the R package folder.\n\n- I created a global.R file in the R folder inside the package, and write a line `utils::globalVariables(c(\"presslog_ames\"))` to avoid the global variable binding problem. The package passed the check with no problems. In this blog, I switched to the method used in class, i.e., add `presslog_ames <- NULL` and `data(presslog_ames, envir  = enviroment())` to the function, and specify `importFrom utils data`.\n\n\n- Fix the dependencies by writing appropriate `importFrom` argument in front of the functions.\n\nIn this blog, when I try function call `get_presslog (\"2023-02-14\", to = \"2023-02-14\")`, I get error \"character string is not in a standard unambiguous format\". The function `get_presslog` is written for `presslog_ames.rda` where the `Call Received Date/Time` is a date object. However, the `Call Received Date/Time` in the current file is character. So I updated the dataset.\n ",
