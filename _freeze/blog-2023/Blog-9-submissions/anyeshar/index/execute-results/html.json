Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.\n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\nWarning: cannot open file 'presslog-20230306.csv': No such file or directoryError in file(file, \"rt\") : cannot open the connection\n\nThis was due to the fact that we updated the presslog date to the current day we were working on it. That means if we used it a different day, it would be outdated. I changed the file it was looking for to be a general press log file. It did not have a specific date attatched.\n\nget_presslog <- function(from, to) {\n  df <- utils::read.csv(\"presslog-%s%02d%02d.csv\") # Change the date to be today's date\n  df[c('Date', 'Time')] <- stringr::str_split_fixed(df$Call.Received.Date.Time, ' ', 2)\n  calls <- df[df$Date >= from & df$Date <= to, ]\n  print(calls)\n  \nWhile this isn't an absolute solution because it depends on the previous function to save as presslog-%s%02d%02d.csv. This does work for any date and we will not have to change the date every time. \n",
