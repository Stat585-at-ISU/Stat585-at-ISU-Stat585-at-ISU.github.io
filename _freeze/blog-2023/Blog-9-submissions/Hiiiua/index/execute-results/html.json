Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.\n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\n\n*my answer*\n\nThe warning message from the item I fixed is  \n`❯ checking dependencies in R code ... WARNING   '::' or ':::' import not declared from: ‘purrr’`\n\nThis must results from using a function from \\`purrr\\` package with import missing, so I went to the R code, spotted the function with code `purrr::` . In the function defined there, I added one line with `#' @import purrr`, ran the function `devtool::document` to make sure \\`NAMESPACE\\` is properly updated, I also update `Imports` in `DESCRIPTION`.\n\nThis is an easy warning to fixed as long as familiarizing with the documentation process in R package and being able to find the function loaded the package.\n",
