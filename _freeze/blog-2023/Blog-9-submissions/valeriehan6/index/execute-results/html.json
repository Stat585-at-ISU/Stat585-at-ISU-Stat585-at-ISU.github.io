Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.\n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\n\nI fixed a note in Team 2's package. The note was\n\n```\nchecking top-level files ... NOTE\n  Non-standard file/directory found at top level:\n    ‘presslog_amespd_2023-03-07.pdf’\n```\n\nI looked up the note on Google and found a [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48955103/non-standard-file-directory-found-at-top-level-readme-rmd-persists-even-after) describing a similar issue. I then resolved the note by adding `^presslog_amespd_2023-03-07\\.pdf$` to the `.Rbuildignore` file.\n\n\n\n",
