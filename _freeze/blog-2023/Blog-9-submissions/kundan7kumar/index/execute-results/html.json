Please edit that file -->\n<!-- badges: start -->\n[![Frontmatter check](../../actions/workflows/check-yaml.yaml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/check-yaml.yaml)\n<!-- badges: end -->\n\n## Prompt:\n\nFix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. \n\n## Instructions:\n\nWhat we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. \n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe error, i am getting \nError in `purrr::map()`:\nâ„¹ In index: 1.\nCaused by error:\n! HTTP error 401.\n  Bad credentials\n\n  Rate limit remaining: 59/60\n  Rate limit reset at: 2023-03-29 03:21:47 UTC\n  \nDescribe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.\n\n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\nI tried fixing the error by setting the key the github but it is not working. I am not sure what causing the error.I have key set up earlier,it is working fine for others.\n\nError:\nConsider adding\n    importFrom(\"utils\", \"download.file\", \"write.csv\")\n  to your NAMESPACE file.\n  \nFinally, I fixed the error and able to fix few warning and notes check for Team3.\n\n1.  I have changed  separate(Call_Received_Date_Time) function to  separate('Call_Received_Date_Time') as it is unable to recognize the variable globally.\n\n2. I have included the few imports and param in the R file like \n#' @importFrom utils download.file\n\n#' @importFrom magrittr %>%\n\n#' @importFrom lubridate ymd_hms\n\n#' @importFrom pdftools pdf_text\n\n#' @importFrom stringr str_replace_all\n\n#' @param pdf name of pdf with data\n\n#' @param save_as optional for saving a csv file\n\nThis helps to fix the 2 notes to 0 notes , but unable to fix the 2 warning.\n",
