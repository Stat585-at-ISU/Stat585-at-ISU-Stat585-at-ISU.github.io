I decided to focus on the errors regarding the get_presslog function:\n\n-   get_presslog: no visible binding for global variable 'presslog_ames'\n-   get_presslog: no visible global function definition for 'ymd'\n-   get_presslog: no visible global function definition for '%\\>%'\n-   get_presslog: no visible binding for global variable 'Call_Received_Date'\\`\n\nI fixed the first error by specifically referencing the package of origin for the presslog_ames data object.\n\n| `Team3::presslog_ames` rather than `presslog_ames`.\n\nNext, I added similar references for all instances of the `ymd()` function.\n\n| `lubridate::ymd()` rather than `ymd()`.\n\nWhile attempting to solve the final warning for the get_presslog function, I ran into a plethora of issues. I added the prefix `.data$` to eliminate the visible binding problem, but then I needed to add `@importFrom rlang .data` to the roxygen comments.\n\n| `.data$Call_Received_Date` rather than `Call_Received_Date`\n\nOnce I added the `@importFrom` tag, ran `devtools::document()`, and added `rlang` to the description file, I thought I was in the clear. However, I received the following error when performing the check:\n\n| `No root directory found in C:/Users/[my directories]/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all oits parent     directories. Root criterion: contains a file \"DESCRIPTION\" with contents matching \"^Package:`\n\nI struggled with this problem but figured out that the description file had a small error in it. Instead of `imports:`, the description file had `import:` which caused not to recognize the following packages to import.\n\nAfter fixing this error, I ran `devtools::check()` and the get_presslog binding or definition issues were resolved.\n",
