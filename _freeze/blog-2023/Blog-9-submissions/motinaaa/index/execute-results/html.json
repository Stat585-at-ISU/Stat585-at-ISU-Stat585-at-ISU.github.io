Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.\n\n**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**\n\nFirstly, I did eeny meeny miny moe to pick a number, got 5, so I checked Team5 package:))\n\nI ran the `check()`, No warnings or errors, just some notes I saw.\nFirst note said `all declared imports should be used`.\nSo I went to the description file and removed the mentioned packages from imports. Easy-peasy, fixed that note.\n\nNext note was about `missing dependencies to other packages`.\nChecked the .R code, and I added the dependencies in the description file under imports. Sorted!\n\nAnother note was about considering adding `importFrom(\"stats\",\"filter\")`.\nAddressed this by going to the .R file and adding `dplyr::` before `filter` function.\nThen added `@importFrom dplyr filter` in the beginning of the file.\nAfter that, ran `document()` to build them in the `NAMESPACE` file and then ran `check()`.\nFixed a bunch of these notes too!\n\nThen I tackled the `global bindings` and added `\"Variable_Name\" <- \"Variable_Name\" <- NULL` to the addressed functions.\nTadaaaaa, green checkmarks all around for Team 5! Woohoo!\n\nI think I was supposed to fix just one of these notes, but my OCD kicked in and I ended up fixing them all. Just wanted to see those green marks! ðŸ˜…\n",
