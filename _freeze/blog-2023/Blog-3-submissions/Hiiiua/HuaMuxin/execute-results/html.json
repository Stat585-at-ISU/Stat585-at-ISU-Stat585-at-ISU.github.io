Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. \n\n\n\n### What we want: build a book\n\nBuild the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.\n2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.\n3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.\n4. The book will be available in html format as index.html\n\n**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. \n\nI got the word **pseudo-class**.\n\n### What to do when things don't work?\n\nErrors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.\n\n- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. \n\n- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)\n\n- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).\n\n- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions > Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. \n\n- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own does not count!). \n\n\n**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)\n\nI got most of the problem of *package not found*, so the most reasonable way to do is install these packages, for the most of time, it worked well.       \nHowever, there were two problems took more efforts.       \nThe first one is *Error in if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1 : the condition has length > 1\nCalls: local ... withVisible -> eval_with_user_handlers -> eval -> eval*. This Error was very specific that this is an error came from the file *Control-flow.Rmd*. I went straight to this file and spotted the chunk raising the error. I noticed the chunks nearby have similar code expect they specified `Error = TRUE`. I tried to add this command to the chunk and it just worked!\nThe second peoblem was more tricky. I got *`dev.control()` called without an open graphics device       https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/issues/42*. There was also some complaining about *emo* not installed. I was trying to solve it by installing it. Turned out there was no matching library for R version. I searched google to find I should install things from github. But the trickt part is that `devtool` should be the ideal way to do that, but my R wouldn't let me to do so and kept asking me to restart R session. Eventually this is solved by installing and running *remotes* with rejecting R session restart request.\n\nSubmit to your repo and you are done!\n",
