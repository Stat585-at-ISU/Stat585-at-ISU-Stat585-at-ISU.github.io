Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. \n\n\n\n### What we want: build a book\n\nBuild the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.\n2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.\n3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.\n4. The book will be available in html format as index.html\n\n**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. \n\nThe last word in chapter 15 is \"class.\" The last word in chapter 15 before the exercises is \"packages.\"\n\n\n\n### What to do when things don't work?\n\nErrors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.\n\n- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. \n\n- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)\n\n- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).\n\n- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions > Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. \n\n- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own does not count!). \n\n\n**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)\n\n\n\n\nI was lucky not to run into any huge problems building the book. The biggest problem was an error involving the `emo` package. Unlike the other missing packages, it couldn't be installed with `install.packages(\"emo\")`. However, through a quick Google search of the error returned from the `install.packages(\"emo\")` command, I found a [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25721884/how-should-i-deal-with-package-xxx-is-not-available-for-r-version-x-y-z-wa](Stack Overflow post) asking about a similar error. A helpful answer informed me that this error could be because the package is not in CRAN, so I decided to google the package. This led me to a Github repo for the package with instructions on how to install it: `devtools::install_github(\"hadley/emo\")`.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmit to your repo and you are done!\n\n",
