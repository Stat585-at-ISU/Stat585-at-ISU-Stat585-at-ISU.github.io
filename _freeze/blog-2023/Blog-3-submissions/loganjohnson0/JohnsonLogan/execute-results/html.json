Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. \n\n\n\n### What we want: build a book\n\nBuild the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.\n2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.\n3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.\n4. The book will be available in html format as index.html\n\n**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. \n\n### My Response\n\nThe last word in chapter 15 in both the PDF and HTML versions that I generated was \"person.\"\n\n\n### What to do when things don't work?\n\nErrors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.\n\n- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. \n\n- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)\n\n- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).\n\n- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions > Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. \n\n- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own does not count!). \n\n\n**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)\n\n### My Response\n\nThe whole process of downloading the repository was easy, despite the sheer number of files that are included with the process. Some challenges that I faced included many errors while trying to create the book. Some of the errors I faced included:\n\n- Error due to \"___ package not found\"\n- Error: C stack usage 7970272 is too close to the limit\n- Package fontspec Error: The font \"Inconsolata\" cannot be found\n- Bookdown: ! LaTeX Error: Command \\href undefined\n\nIt was easy to solve those issues with packages not found. I simply downloaded the necessary package called out in the error messages. I had no issues with this issue.\n\nThe error with \"C stack usage too close to the limit\" was a confusing error for me. I wasn't able to find a clear answer online anywhere. The issue seems to stem from computer memory issues and the issue of a recursive function that is large. Essentially to solve this, I restarted the RStudio session and then the issue seemed to resolve itself. I only faced it a time or two.\n\nAs simple as the missing \"Inconsolata\" font seemed to me, I spent a frustrating amount of time trying to figure out how to resolve this issue. I first tried to find a way to download the \"fontspec\" package with is in CTAN and not CRAN. My inexperience with LaTeX also didn't help in this instance. I downloaded the package \"tinytex.\" This seemed to help some issues, but didn't solve the specific font issue. I ultimately realized that I simply needed to download the font from Google Fonts. That was a simple, yet frustratingly long issue.\n\nLastly, the LaTeX Error: Command \\href undefined lead me to the GitHub respostory of Yihui Xie for bookdown. The specific code and changes were made to a specific LaTeX file. I was able to find this same type of file in Hadley's advr repository. I made a change locally by adding \"\\usepackage{hyperref}\" before the issue of \"LaTeX Error: Command \\href undefined.\" After this final change, the book was able to render with no issues.\n\n\n\n\nSubmit to your repo and you are done!\n\n",
