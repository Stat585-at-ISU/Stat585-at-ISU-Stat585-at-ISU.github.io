Please edit that file -->\n\n\n\n\n\n## Prompt:\n\n\nThe goal of this  week's blog is to document what you are doing when things do not go according to plan. \n\nSimilar to previous exercises, we have a specific use case in mind: we want to build a book from a github repository. \n\nWhat happens in practice usually, is that we run into some problems. \nSo your real task turns into that of a bug-hunter and fixer. Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. \n\n\n\n### What we want: build a book\n\nBuild the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.\n2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.\n3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.\n4. The book will be available in html format as index.html\n\n**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. \n\nAnswer: \"pseudo-class\" is the last word of Chapter 15. I obtained this answer by rendering the book into HTML format.\n\n\n**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)\n\nThe biggest problem was knitting the book to pdf. I tried two LaTeX distributions (MiKTex and TinyTeX) and read several responses to similar questions on Stack Overflow and the Posit Community. Following the solutions, I installed, uninstalled and updated packages, and set the PATH by editing the system environment variables; however the error \"LaTeX failed to compile _main.tex\" persisted. Unfortunately I did not find a solution for this problem, but by opening a new Rmarkdown file, I typed Sys.which(\"pdflatex\") and RStudio found the Tinytex package installed. I also successfully knitted a pdf document using this new file. Thus, there must be something wrong in the book script.\n\n\n\n",
