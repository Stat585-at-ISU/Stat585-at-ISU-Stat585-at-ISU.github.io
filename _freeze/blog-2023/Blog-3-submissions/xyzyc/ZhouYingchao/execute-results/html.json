Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. \n\n\n\n### What we want: build a book\n\nBuild the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.\n2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.\n3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.\n4. The book will be available in html format as index.html\n\n**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. \n\n\n### What to do when things don't work?\n\nErrors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.\n\n- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. \n\nNo.\n\n- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)\n\nI can not compile the book in blog 3. The error I get is caused by line 106 of Control-flow.Rmd.\n\nIn  Control-flow.Rmd, the author demonstrates what are the invalid inputs to an `if` statement. We know usually the condition should be a single `TRUE` or `FALSE`. But there is an exception:\n\nIn line 101, the author sets `Sys.setenv(\"_R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_\" = \"false\")` to allow an if statement to take a condition more than length 1. I run `Sys.getenv()` to make sure `_R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_`  is indeed set to `\"false\"`.\n\nIn line 106, the author writes `if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1` and says this should generate a warning message but not an error. However, now R generates an error \"the condition has length > 1\" and does not compile Control-flow.Rmd, and therefore fail to compile the book.\n\n\n- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).\n\nI added `error = TRUE` in the chunk options so the compilation does not stop at error so the book can be built.\n\n- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions > Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. \n\n- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own does not count!). \n\n\n**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)\n\nAnother big problem I have is a .sty file is missing for Latex. By clicking on \"Build Book\" button, the default output is a pdf file. Later I found index.Rmd file and knitted it into index.html.  \n\nSubmit to your repo and you are done!\n\n",
