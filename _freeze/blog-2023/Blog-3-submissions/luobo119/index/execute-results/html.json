Please edit that file -->\n\n\n\n\n\n## Prompt:\n\n\nThe goal of this  week's blog is to document what you are doing when things do not go according to plan. \n\nSimilar to previous exercises, we have a specific use case in mind: we want to build a book from a github repository. \n\nWhat happens in practice usually, is that we run into some problems. \nSo your real task turns into that of a bug-hunter and fixer. Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. \n\n\n\n### What we want: build a book\n\nBuild the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.\n2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.\n3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.\n4. The book will be available in html format as index.html\n\n**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. \n\n**Answer:** Last word in chapter 15 is **class** in index.html or **pseudo-class** if references included.\n\n### What to do when things don't work?\n\nErrors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.\n\n- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. \n\n- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)\n\n- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).\n\n- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions > Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. \n\n- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own does not count!). \n\n\n**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)\n\nThe biggest problem is that it is hard to find what is wrong when I have the error 'dev.control() called without an open graphics device' because it does not point to any specific file that might contain the problem. I found someone had the same issue in one GitHub post, and one person commented that there might be some missing pieces in the package 'Cairo'. I followed his instructions and solved the problem.\n\nAccording to my experience in building the book, we need to update and install all the packages used first. Then I still encountered some errors before I could successfully compile the book. I'd like to record all the problems I encountered and my solutions here.\n\n* **Error in get(genname, envir = envir) : object 'wrap' not found**\\\n  **Calls: local ... withVisible -> eval -> eval -> registerS3method -> get**\n  + The error is from 'common.R' file 'registerS3method' function. Because for knitr 1.40, knitr:::wrap() has been removed, and knitr::sew() is used instead.\n  + Using registerS3method(\"sew\", ...) instead of registerS3method(\"sew\", ...).\n* **Error in if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1 : the condition has length > 1**\n  + The error is from 'Control-flow.Rmd' file.\n  + Showing the errors without stopping R by adding chunk option 'error=TRUE'\n* **Error in dev.control(displaylist = if (record) \"enable\" else \"inhibit\") :**\\\n  **dev.control() called without an open graphics device**\\\n  **Calls: local ... call_block -> block_exec -> eng_r -> chunk_device -> dev.control**\\\n  + This is because for mac, XQuartz is missing for package 'Cairo'. \n  + Downloading 'Quartz X11' and re-install 'Cairo'. (https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/issues/42)\n\n* **Package fontspec Error: The font \"Inconsolata\" cannot be found.**\n  + Installing the font by using \\\n    *brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts*\\\n    *brew install --cask font-Inconsolata*\n\n* **LaTeX Error: Command \\\\href undefined.**\n  + Adding '\\\\usepackage{hyperref}' in 'latex/preamble.tex'.\n\nAppendix:\n\n1. https://github.com/hadley/r-pkgs/blob/main/common.R\\\n2. https://github.com/statcomputing/compiling-advanced-r-beili0022\\\n3. https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-crc/commit/683e5fbd87478240c84cbebaf04058dd685090c8\n<!-- You can write your experience directly into the `README.Rmd` file. Just make sure that you change the yaml at the top: change the author at the top, and give your post a new title (don't change the category :))  -->\n\n<!-- Commit and push to your repo and you are done! -->\n\n",
