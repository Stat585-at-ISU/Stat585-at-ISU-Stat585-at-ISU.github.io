Please edit that file -->\n\n\n\n\n\n## Prompt:\n\n\nThe goal of this  week's blog is to document what you are doing when things do not go according to plan. \n\nSimilar to previous exercises, we have a specific use case in mind: we want to build a book from a github repository. \n\nWhat happens in practice usually, is that we run into some problems. \nSo your real task turns into that of a bug-hunter and fixer. Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. \n\n\n\n### What we want: build a book\n\nBuild the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.\n2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.\n3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.\n4. The book will be available in html format as index.html\n\n**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. \n\n\n### What to do when things don't work?\n\nErrors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.\n\n- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. \n\n- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)\n\n- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).\n\n- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions > Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. \n\n- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own does not count!). \n\n\n**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)\n\n\nYou can write your experience directly into the `README.Rmd` file. Just make sure that you change the yaml at the top: change the author at the top, and give your post a new title (don't change the category :)) \n\nCommit and push to your repo and you are done!\n\n\nANSWER SECTION\n\nLAST WORD\n\nThe last word in Chapter 15 is ```class``` in the sentence, ```Define a length method for the Person class.```\n\nPROCESS:\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to compile the pdf book, but I was able to get the bs4 version! Here was the process I followed to working through the errors. \n\nI was able to copy the repository into a local folder on my PC and open up all the files without an issue. I ran into a problem initially because I didn't have the ```library(bookdown)``` package.  As I was trying to download the package, I came across the error \n\n```\nWARNING: Rtools is required to build R packages but is not currently installed. Please download and install the appropriate version of Rtools before proceeding:\n```\n\nWhich I tried to overcome with a clean install of R once again. This unfortunately did not fix the error that I had and so I ran ```install.packages(\"Rtools\")``` to be greeted with another error.\n\n```\nWarning in install.packages :\n  package ‘Rtools’ is not available for this version of R\n```\n\nAt which point I did a run around forums on \"community.rstudio\" to find that I had to download Rtools from the Cran project. I am still unsure of why I need Rtools given that the documentation for Rtools43 indicates that \"Moreover, online build services are available to check and build R packages for Windows, for which again one does not need to install Rtools43 locally.\"\n\nInstalling Rtools43 did not make a noticeable difference, though I think this was because I actually needed the Rtools40 instead. However, I was now able to download the ```bookdown``` package and could see it in my packages list in Rstudio to start compiling. \n\nOnce I ran the compile, I saw that I had the same issue as everyone else regarding the 'wrap' argument in the registerS3method() argument which I then changed and re-compiled. I ran into an error about a package called ```lobstr``` which I did not have so I installed that package as well and the compiler continued.\n\nI came across an error regarding a package called ```emo``` that I did not have and followed the suggestion on the discussions forum to use ```devtools```  to install it. At this point in the console, I was asked to install Rtools40 which I realized might have been the correct version to install since my Rtools43 installation did not help here. I installed Rtools40 and followed Landon's suggestion in the Canvas Discussions to add it to my PATH. \n\nI was able to successfully install ```emo``` and recompiled. I then ran into another error about not having the package ```sloop``` and ran an install on that. I followed the same procedure for package ```zeallot```, ```bench```, and ```ggbeeswarm```. After this, the compiler ran without error for longer than 5 minutes to tweak the files that were generated from the first processing of the knit. The following error then came about. \n\n```\nError: LaTeX failed to compile _main.tex. See https://yihui.org/tinytex/r/#debugging for debugging tips. See _main.log for more info.\nExecution halted\nError: bookdown::render_book() failed to render the output format 'bookdown::pdf_book'.\nExecution halted\n```\n\nKnowing it was the _main.tex file, I tried to check where the error might be and I found within my error log the following code.\n\n```\n2023-02-11 13:58:26,032-0600 INFO  xelatex - starting with command line: C:\\Users\\harun\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\MIKTEX~1.9\\miktex\\bin\\x64\\xelatex.exe -halt-on-error -interaction=batchmode _main.tex\n2023-02-11 13:58:26,046-0600 INFO  xelatex - allowing known shell commands\n2023-02-11 13:58:26,046-0600 INFO  xelatex - enabling input (output) from (to) processes\n2023-02-11 13:58:26,062-0600 INFO  xelatex - going to create file: xelatex.fmt\n2023-02-11 13:58:30,355-0600 FATAL xelatex - GUI framework cannot be initialized.\n2023-02-11 13:58:30,355-0600 FATAL xelatex - Info: \n2023-02-11 13:58:30,355-0600 FATAL xelatex - Source: Libraries\\MiKTeX\\UI\\Qt\\mikuiqt.cpp\n2023-02-11 13:58:30,355-0600 FATAL xelatex - Line: 77\n2023-02-11 13:58:30,356-0600 INFO  xelatex - finishing with exit code 1\n```\n\nLine 77 of _main.tex has the code:\n```\nlibrary(calc)\n```\n\nI'm not LateX savvy enough to understand what's going on here but the former error in Rstudio indicates that the problem is with the pdf_book format of the build and this seems to be confirmed reading through the discussions on Canvas. I could not find the problem within the specified tex file to overcome the compiling issue.\n\nAs a workaround suggested by a classmate, I decided to run the ```bookdown::bs4_book``` build to see if I could at least get that working. It compiled without error and I was able to submit the deliverable through that format instead.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98118631/218279471-f505bb5b-6072-43b0-ad02-a836e7614f4a.png)\n\n\n",
