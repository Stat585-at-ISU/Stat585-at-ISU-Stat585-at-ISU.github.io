Please edit that file -->\n\n\n\n\n\n## Prompt:\n\n\nThe goal of this  week's blog is to document what you are doing when things do not go according to plan. \n\nSimilar to previous exercises, we have a specific use case in mind: we want to build a book from a github repository. \n\nWhat happens in practice usually, is that we run into some problems. \nSo your real task turns into that of a bug-hunter and fixer. Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. \n\n\n\n### What we want: build a book\n\nBuild the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.\n2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.\n3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.\n4. The book will be available in html format as index.html\n\n**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. \n\nIt took forever to compile, but I finally got the HTML version to work!\n\nThe last word in chapter 15? CLASS! IT IS CLASS!\n\n\n### What to do when things don't work?\n\nErrors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.\n\n- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. \n\n- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)\n\n- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).\n\n- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions > Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. \n\n- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own does not count!). \n\n\n**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)\n\n- Building the book has been a pain! :))\n- The **first** error I got was **\"Failed to load Cairo DLL\"** in R, which is because I use. MacOS. According to CRAN, it's related to XQuartz since it's not part of OS X anymore. I installed XQuartz and basically all Cairo problems are fixed.\n\n- The next error was object **'wrap' not found!**\n\n- I fixed the error by changing \"wrap\" to \"sew\" in the registerS3method() function in common.R.\n\n\n- In the meantime, I installed a bunch of packages to get going! :))\n\n- After that, I get to a big one! Error in **if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1 : the condition has length > 1**\n\n- It turns out the behavior described is now the default (as of R 4.2.0).In other words, the command \"if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1\" will fail no matter what condition is set. To fix this, I just set error=TRUE in the addressed code chunk!\n\n\n- Again, there was a bunch of missing packages! :))\n\n- At this point it was taking almost 15-20 minutes to compile the book, and I ended up getting an error saying **LaTeX failed to compile _main.tex.**\n\n- I tried updating tinytex, but I got the same error! I installed tlmgr to install packages, but it didn't work! As I write this I'm trying options(tinytex.verbose = TRUE) to see if it fixes the error. I'll let you know how it goes!\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n- Hey, it's been a while! My PDF version wouldn't compile, but I made it work with HTML! I'm still trying to fix the LaTex error! :)\n\n\n\nYou can write your experience directly into the `README.Rmd` file. Just make sure that you change the yaml at the top: change the author at the top, and give your post a new title (don't change the category :)) \n\nCommit and push to your repo and you are done!\n\n",
