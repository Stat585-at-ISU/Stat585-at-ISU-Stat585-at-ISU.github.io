Now that we start to apply scraping mechanisms, we need to think about how to apply those skills without becoming a burden to the internet society.\n\nFind sources on ethical web scraping - some readings that might help you get started with that are:\n\n-   [James Densmore](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01)\n\n-   R package [polite](https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite)\n\n-   [JAMI \\@ EMPIRICAL](https://www.empiricaldata.org/dataladyblog/a-guide-to-ethical-web-scraping)\n\nAfter reading through some of the ethics essays write a blog post addressing the following questions:\n\n1.  **What are your main three takeaways for ethical web scraping? - Give examples, or cite your sources.**\n\n    Prior to the reading, I was not aware of User Agent strings or robot.txt files. I think these two concepts, along with public APIs, are important to understand as an ethical web scraper. Despite using packages like rvest and Python's Beautiful Soup in the past, I had never encountered the need for a User Agent string or interaction with a robots.txt file. James Densmore did a great job outlining these topics in his [towardsdatascience article](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01). If everyone introduced themselves to the site owners via a User Agent string, checked what the house rules were via the robot.txt file, and utilized public API's when available, site owners might be less likely to dissuade scrapping.\n\n2.  **What is a ROBOTS.TXT file? Identify one instance and explain what it allows/prevents.**\n\n    The ROBOT.txt can prevent scrappers from accessing data whether that is a web page, media file, or resource files. In a [informative article](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro) by Google, the search giant explains how website owners use robot.txt to indicate which URLs they would like crawled by Google and to avoid too much traffic.\n\n3.  **Identify a website that you would like to scrape (or one an example from class) and implement a scrape using the `polite` package.**\n\n    I utilized the polite package to scrap information on notable table tennis players from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis).\n\nFirst, I started by using `bow()` to introduce myself to the page.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_c1352cdb6c849ccfeb3a7427eaf5051b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(polite)\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nsession <- bow(\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, I let the `scrape()` function know that I had properly introduced myself and passed the result to `html_nodes()` to get the table I was looking for by specifying the class. I passed the html to the `html_table()` function to nicely parse it into appealing R terms for me. Finally, I printed my object and reflected on how much I like Wikipedia.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_a8b3a761ddde83371bb5fabb5821ee11'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresult <- scrape(session) |>\n  html_nodes(\".wikitable\") |>\n  html_table()\n\nresult\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 11 × 7\n   Name            Gender Nationality `Times won`    `Times won`   Times…¹ ``   \n   <chr>           <chr>  <chr>       <chr>          <chr>         <chr>   <chr>\n 1 Name            Gender Nationality Olympics       World Champi… World … \"\"   \n 2 Jan-Ove Waldner Male   Sweden      1 (1992)       2 (1989, 199… 1 (199… \"[76…\n 3 Deng Yaping     Female China       2 (1992, 1996) 3 (1991, 199… 1 (199… \"[77…\n 4 Liu Guoliang    Male   China       1 (1996)       1 (1999)      1 (199… \"[78…\n 5 Wang Nan        Female China       1 (2000)       3 (1999, 200… 4 (199… \"[79…\n 6 Kong Linghui    Male   China       1 (2000)       1 (1995)      1 (199… \"[80…\n 7 Zhang Yining    Female China       2 (2004, 2008) 2 (2005, 200… 4 (200… \"[81…\n 8 Zhang Jike      Male   China       1 (2012)       2 (2011, 201… 2 (201… \"[82…\n 9 Li Xiaoxia      Female China       1 (2012)       1 (2013)      1 (200… \"[83…\n10 Ding Ning       Female China       1 (2016)       3 (2011, 201… 2 (201… \"[84…\n11 Ma Long         Male   China       2 (2016, 2020) 3 (2015, 201… 2 (201…  <NA>\n# … with abbreviated variable name ¹​`Times won`\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
