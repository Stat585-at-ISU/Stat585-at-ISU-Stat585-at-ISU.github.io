Now that we start to apply scraping mechanisms, we need to think about how to apply those skills without becoming a burden to the internet society.\n\nFind sources on ethical web scraping - some readings that might help you get started with that are:\n\n-   [James Densmore](https://towardsdatascience.com/ethics-in-web-scraping-b96b18136f01)\n\n-   R package [polite](https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite)\n\n-   [JAMI \\@ EMPIRICAL](https://www.empiricaldata.org/dataladyblog/a-guide-to-ethical-web-scraping)\n\nAfter reading through some of the ethics essays write a blog post addressing the following questions:\n\n1.  **What are your main three takeaways for ethical web scraping? - Give examples, or cite your sources.**\n\n- Both readings discussed the importance of using an API first. I had thought of this from the side of the scraper but rarely from the side of the page owner and found it useful to be thinking about as I go on developing tools. I'm convinced that with any online platform that I would like to host should have a more serious contemplation about the development of APIs for public or quasi-public access.   \n\n- The topic of identification was also interesting since I've mostly used APIs that used keys instead of direct pulls off the web. While I've asked for personal permission and cited the material I took from a web-scraping portion of a project, I don't recall adding my name and information for the person to keep record of in the future. I'll certainly be more mindful of it now.\n\n- My third takeaway, which is less direct, relates to the approach of the authors in these articles. They say the word 'ethics' but what they really describe are scraping etiquette. I think deeper engagement with the ethics of scraping is necessary so that guiding principles can uniformly be set in place. While I found the blogs to be useful, I am still left with questions about the moral systems behind scraping and how these values could shape the future of scraping practice and legality.\n\n2.  **What is a ROBOTS.TXT file? Identify one instance and explain what it allows/prevents.**\n\n- The purpose of a ROBOTS.TXT file is to help guide incoming web traffic by directing search engine crawlers to access particular portions of your webpage. An example that I can think of might be that if you run a page which has a news feed but also a section where users are directed to a log-in portal, you would want the log-in portal to be protected from unnecessary traffic to lessen any security risks.\n\n3.  **Identify a website that you would like to scrape (or one an example from class) and implement a scrape using the `polite` package.**\n\n- I had ambitions to build a systematic scraping method for users with access to the [Historical Statistics of the United States Online Edition](https://hsus.cambridge.org/HSUSWeb/HSUSEntryServlet) but didn't do nearly as well as I thought I would. Instead, I'll demonstrate a polite scrape with a different objective. I would like to know all the popular packages that Dr. Hofmann is working on! I want to perform a scrape that gives me just their names. \n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_42f754b1b1c9e49bcf30d1f3d4c8e507'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(polite)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_ad0d042678e103fc9fc78aaa1a9d9b42'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsession <-bow(\"https://github.com/heike\", user_agent = \"Student from STAT 585 course at ISU\")\nresult <- scrape(session) %>%\n  html_elements(\".repo\") %>% \n  html_text\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_f624db2ca397a75f2e5faddec5233ae9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# These are Dr. Hofmann's current popular packages:\ncat(result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nggparallel gglogo stat590f ggmapr rotations ggpcp\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nSubmit to your repo.
