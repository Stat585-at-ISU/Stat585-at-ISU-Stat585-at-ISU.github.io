You don't always know what you're signing and it could be dangerous. \n- Expanding upon my first takeaway, the reading written by James Densmore on the ethics in web scraping continued to touch on the point that one of the largest issues regarding the ethics of this practice is that not everyone is agreeing on the terms. People are typically innately selfish so what someone may think of as ethical on one end (the scraper) may differ from one on the other end (the site ownder).\n- The third takeaway came from reviewing the R package [polite] ... This brought everything together in terms of the process of scraping not being as scary as I origionally thought. I am typically afraid of getting in trouble or doing something wrong but through the help of this package there is a more clear way of seaking permisison and introducting yourself and following the steps that were laid out in the previous two writtings. \n\n\n2. **What is a ROBOTS.TXT file? Identify one instance and explain what it allows/prevents.**\n\nAccording to Jami @ Empirical ... a ROBOTS.TXT files is ... \"what indicates the web-crawling software where it is allowed (or not allowed) within the website. This is part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP) which are a group of web standards created as a way to regulate how robots crawl the web.\" ... this file typically lives at the root of a site as a plain text file that provides instructions to web robots like search engine crawlers about locations within the website that robots are or are not allowed to crawl and index. \n\n3. **Identify a website that you would like to scrape (or one an example from class) and implement a scrape using the `polite` package.**\n\nTo help work through some examples I utilized the following link: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/05/intro-to-polite-web-scraping-of-soccer-data-with-r/\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nSubmit to your repo. Make sure that all of the github actions pass (check menu item Actions - all of the actions should have green checks)\n\n",
