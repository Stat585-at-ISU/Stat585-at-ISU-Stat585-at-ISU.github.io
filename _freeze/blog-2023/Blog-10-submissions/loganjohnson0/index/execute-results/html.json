Identify one instance and explain what it allows/prevents.**\n3. **Identify a website that you would like to scrape (or one an example from class) and implement a scrape using the `polite` package.**\n\nInstructions:\n\nSubmit to your repo. Make sure that all of the github actions pass (check menu item Actions - all of the actions should have green checks)\n\n",
