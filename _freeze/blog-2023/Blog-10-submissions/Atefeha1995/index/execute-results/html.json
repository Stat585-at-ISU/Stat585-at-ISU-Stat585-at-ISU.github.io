Some websites may expressly forbid scraping or demand that you get consent before doing so.\n\n   - Avoid interfering with how the website functions: You shouldn't disrupt or harm the website in any manner with your scraping activity. This includes not sending        too many requests to the site's servers or doing the scrapping process during non-peak hours.\n\n   - Avoid scraping sensitive data, such as personal identifying information, financial information, or health information, to protect people's privacy.\n\n\nBeing respectful of the websites you are scraping and the people or organizations whose data you are gathering is, in  general, a requirement for ethical web scraping. It is crucial to be open and honest about your objectives and to abstain from any behavior that can endanger the website or specific people.\n\n\n2. **What is a ROBOTS.TXT file? Identify one instance and explain what it allows/prevents.**\n\nA `robots.txt` file, found at the root of a website, tells web robots whether pages or parts of the website should be crawled. It is a plain text file that is open to the public and offers instructions for web robots.\n\nFor example, suppose a website contains sensitive information that should not be available to search engines, including financial data or users' personal information. In that case, the website owner can make a `robots.txt` file and include a directive to forbid search engines from accessing that part. For instance, if the `robots.txt` file has the directive `\"Disallow: /sensitive-data/,\"` search engine bots won't be able to crawl the \"sensitive-data\" part of the website.\n\nBut, a website owner may also utilize the `robots.txt` file to provide the particular search engine bots access to particular pages or parts of the website. For instance, the `robots.txt` directive `\"Allow: /blog/\"` added to the website's code will let web crawlers access the \"/blog/\" area.\n\n3. **Identify a website that you would like to scrape (or one an example from class) and implement a scrape using the `polite` package.**\n\nI used the `polite` package to scrape a sample website. The base URL of the website was `https://www.metacritic.com/` and the specific path I checked was `/movie/ponyo`. Then I looked for the director of the movie, and I got what I wanted.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_1a560e7886f5ccdffb6d4fba03375394'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(polite)\nlibrary(rvest)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_598ed39555fc0cc38e4d50c08fb4ba26'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmc_bow <- bow(\n  url = \"https://www.metacritic.com/\",  # base URL\n  user_agent = \"A Anisi\",  # identify ourselves\n  force = TRUE\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_0488f558f383911afb0533198ae51edb'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsession <- nod(\n  bow = mc_bow,\n  path = \"/movie/ponyo\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_2e161eb2f34fe922bb4556f5e05f28eb'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nscraped_page <- scrape(session)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_f0dd85d137ebb86554acc3de6aeb7447'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnode_result <- html_nodes(\n  scraped_page, \n  css = \".director span\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_07e8a88c85ad4e11da0e16c3a323536d'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntext_result <- html_text(node_result)\ntext_result\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Director:\"      \"Hayao Miyazaki\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nSubmit to your repo.
