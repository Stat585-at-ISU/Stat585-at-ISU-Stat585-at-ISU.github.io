This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.\n\n\nNow start reading ...\n\n\nRead the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.\n\nThen do:\n\n1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**\n\n2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**\n\n3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the depepndencies or explicilty by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**\n\n4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**\n\n5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**\n\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the following questions: \n\n1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**\n\n2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**\n \n\nSubmit this blog post to your blog-6 repo. \n\n\n1. The idea of the renv package is to help with reproducibility in terms of making sure you or anyone who uses your work knows what packages you are using and what versions of them you are using. And then it will help the user find out where to download those packages as well.\n\n\n2. Honestly, everything went very smoothly. After downloading 'renv' I played around a little bit with a couple of the functions and then I was able to find out what packages were being used in my blog 4 project. Then after that I manually made a Description file for the package dependencies. \n",
