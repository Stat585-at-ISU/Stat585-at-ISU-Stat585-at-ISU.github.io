This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.\n\n\nNow start reading ...\n\n\nRead the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.\n\nThen do:\n\n1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**\n\n2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**\n\n3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the depepndencies or explicilty by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**\n\n4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**\n\n5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**\n\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the following questions: \n\n1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**\n\nThe `renv` package is used in R to manage the dependencies a project will have during its development\nand operation. `renv` essentially works as a way to support the reproducibility of projects by tracking\nversion control histories for the packages used in an R project. What I found to be the most useful in\nthe documentation was how R libraries worked without `renv` and with `renv`. Based on this information\nit makes sense to use `renv` in every R project that has a longtitudinal lifespan since tracking packages\nand errors often associated with older versions of packages is an important element to debugging. \n\n2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**\n\nInitializing with `renv` was not very difficult. I think the real trouble for me is that I don't find the \nlayout of what renv produces to be very intuitive so I had difficulties with adding all the dependencies to\nthe environment. I first called a `renv::snapshot()` and followed that with `renv::dependencies()` but I'm not\nentirely sure that it did what I expected it to, I don't have a solid enough understanding to even be able to verify\nin all honesty.\n\nSubmit this blog post to your blog-6 repo. \n\n",
