This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.\n\n\nNow start reading ...\n\n\nRead the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.\n\nThen do:\n\n1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**\n\n2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**\n\n3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the dependencies or explicitly by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**\n\n4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**\n\n5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**\n\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the following questions: \n\n1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**\n\n`renv` packages is for managing the dependencies of a project. By using it we can easily save the R version and dependent packages version and restore the environment in the future. This helps with reproducibility of the project.\n\n2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**\n\nI tested 8 rounds to get things right. In the render-rmarkdown.yaml generated by `usethis` package, `setup-r`, `setup-renv` and `setup-pandoc` are in v1, and I get error which says fail to install R as well as other warnings. After I updated these to v2, I started getting error saying there is no package called rmarkdown, which turned out to be caused by not pushing renv.lock to my repo.\n\n\n \n\nSubmit this blog post to your blog-6 repo. \n\n",
