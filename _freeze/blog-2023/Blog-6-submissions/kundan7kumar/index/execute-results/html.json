Please edit that file -->\n<!-- badges: start -->\n\n[![Frontmatter check](../../actions/workflows/check-yaml.yaml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/check-yaml.yaml)\n[![Render rmarkdown](../../actions/workflows/render-rmarkdown.yaml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/render-rmarkdown.yaml)\n<!-- badges: end -->\n\nIn Blog 5 you had the first exposure to Github Actions. \nWe just checked frontmatter compliance (as we do for this round).\nYou see that we have added a second action - here, we are converting the Rmarkdown document to a markdown file by running `render_rmarkdown` on Github. This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.\n\n\nNow start reading ...\n\n\nRead the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.\n\nThen do:\n\n1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**\n\n2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**\n\n3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the depepndencies or explicilty by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**\n\n4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**\n\n5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**\n\n\nWrite a blog post addressing the following questions: \n\n1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**. \n\n**Solution:**. \n\nThe `renv` package is designed to create a reproducible and consistent environment for R projects. It helps in managing the package dependencies in the project. It helps to isolate and manage the R packages in the project, which can easily be reproduced even if packages are updated or changed over time. It is an effective solution to the common problem of package dependency management in R projects like conda, pipenv in python. It is a great tool for project management.\n\n\n2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**\n \n **Solution:**\nIt was a good learning experience; I was not aware `renv` earlier. The good point of the `renv` package is that it is easier to manage R package and its dependencies within a project. It will help to make the project reproducible and consistent across different environments.\n\n**What went well:**. \n\n- Install using install.packages(\"renv\") and then initialize the workflow with renv::init() . It will create renv folder automatically. I pushed the renv changes to blog4 github.\n\n- We can use renv::snapshot() to save the project's package environment and renv::restore() to restore . It will help in reproducibility.  \n\n- The package lockfile generated by renv made it easy to share my project with others, as they could simply restore the package environment using renv::restore().\n\n**What did not go well:**. \n\nI  found that it is easy to create renv environment, I did easily by installing packages using install.packages(\"renv\") and initialize it. I think that it is a great tool for managing projects. I didn't find any issue till now.\n\nSubmit this blog post to your blog-6 repo. \n\n",
