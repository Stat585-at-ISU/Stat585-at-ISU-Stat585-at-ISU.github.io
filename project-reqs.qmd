For the final project you are asked to create an R package. You are free to choose package functionality, but there should be

- a minimum of five functions with a coherent theme,
- a shiny app show-casing some of the functionality
- a website for the package
- a README page with installation instructions and basic demonstration of functionality
- evidence of testing the functionality
- 8-10 page report detailing your work. This report should be written as a package vignette, included in your packageâ€™s documentation.


You are asked to present your work as a team in one of the speaking slots during dead week and finals week. Each team member is supposed to present for about 5 mins.
