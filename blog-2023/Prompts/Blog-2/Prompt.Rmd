git and Github are tools for helping with versioning of files in collaborative efforts as well as archiving entries for your future self. 
Unfortunately working with git isn't always completely straightforward. 
Jenny Bryan's book "Happy git and github with R" helps with that. The book is available from [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/). Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.
