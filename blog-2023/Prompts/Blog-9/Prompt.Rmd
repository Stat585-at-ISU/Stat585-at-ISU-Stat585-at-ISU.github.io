## Prompt:

This blog prompt is extremely simple: fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. 

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. 


## Submission

Push the blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure that the yaml-front-matter check passes.
