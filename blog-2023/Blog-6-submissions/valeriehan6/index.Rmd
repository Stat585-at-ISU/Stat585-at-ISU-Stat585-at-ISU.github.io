What happens when we change the Rmd file and commit?

In Blog 5 you had the first exposure to Github Actions. 
We just checked frontmatter compliance (as we do for this round).
You see that we have added a second action - here, we are converting the Rmarkdown document to a markdown file by running `render_rmarkdown` on Github. This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.


Now start reading ...


Read the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.

Then do:

1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**

1b. **Go to your blog 4 repo, and run the command** `usethis::use_github_action("render-rmarkdown.yaml")` This creates the file `render-rmarkdown.yaml` inside the folder `.github/workflows` in your repo. Add it to the repository and push it.


1c. **Optional - but maybe educational:** make a change to your Rmd file with the blog post (just a small change), and push it. Then go to your github site and watch the render-rmarkdown action fail.

2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**

3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the depepndencies or explicilty by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**

4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**

5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**


Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**

The `renv` package helps with one piece of reproducibility by recording the versions of R and packages that our project is running on. It also can make it easier to reinstall the version of those packages for a specific project that has had its versions recorded using `renv`.

2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**
 
It was really cool to be able to run just a couple functions to record version numbers of R and the packages my project was dependent on. There were a lot of debugging along the way, though. Lessons learned: make sure to add `renv.lock` to the git repo, and try a newer version of a package if you get an error like `Error: install of package 'stringi' failed [error code 1]`. In general, the downside of using `renv` was that the error messages were not as informative as I would've liked, there weren't really stackoverflow posts addressing my errors, and the vignette for the package could've been more informative about troubleshooting/error messages.
