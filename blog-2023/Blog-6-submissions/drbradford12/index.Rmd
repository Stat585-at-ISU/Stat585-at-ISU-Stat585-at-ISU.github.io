What happens when we change the Rmd file and commit?

In Blog 5 you had the first exposure to Github Actions. 
We just checked frontmatter compliance (as we do for this round).
You see that we have added a second action - here, we are converting the Rmarkdown document to a markdown file by running `render_rmarkdown` on Github. This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.


Now start reading ...


Read the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.

Then do:

1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**

2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**

3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the depepndencies or explicilty by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**

4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**

5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**


Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**


Denise's Answer:

The idea of the `renv` package is a tool for managing packages in R that helps with managing dependencies, making projects repeatable, and working together on R projects. It lets users set up and manage separate environments for each project. These environments have all the R packages and versions needed to run the project. This keeps packages and versions from getting in the way of each other, which can lead to errors.


2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**

Denise's Answer:

+ The Good:

Since I will be working more in Python during the class, it may be useful to show that `renv` in R works with Python environments (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/renv/vignettes/python.html). It's great to know that we can do this when completing a project that may need both Python and R elements.

+ The Bad:

If we wanted to reproduce the same actions in Python, one will need to have a Linux computer. The following is from a beta package (https://pypi.org/project/renv/) that may be used for a similiar outcome in R. I can't be completely sure since I work with a Mac.
