What happens when we change the Rmd file and commit?

In Blog 5 you had the first exposure to Github Actions. 
We just checked frontmatter compliance (as we do for this round).
You see that we have added a second action - here, we are converting the Rmarkdown document to a markdown file by running `render_rmarkdown` on Github. This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.


Now start reading ...


Read the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.

Then do:

1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**

2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**

3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the depepndencies or explicilty by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**

4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**

5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**


Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**

The `renv` package is used in R to manage the dependencies a project will have during its development
and operation. `renv` essentially works as a way to support the reproducibility of projects by tracking
version control histories for the packages used in an R project. What I found to be the most useful in
the documentation was how R libraries worked without `renv` and with `renv`. Based on this information
it makes sense to use `renv` in every R project that has a longtitudinal lifespan since tracking packages
and errors often associated with older versions of packages is an important element to debugging. 

2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**

Initializing with `renv` was not very difficult. I think the real trouble for me is that I don't find the 
layout of what renv produces to be very intuitive so I had difficulties with adding all the dependencies to
the environment. I first called a `renv::snapshot()` and followed that with `renv::dependencies()` but I'm not
entirely sure that it did what I expected it to, I don't have a solid enough understanding to even be able to verify
in all honesty.
