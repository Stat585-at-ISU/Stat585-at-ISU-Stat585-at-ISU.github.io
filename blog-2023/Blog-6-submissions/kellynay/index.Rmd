What happens when we change the Rmd file and commit?

In Blog 5 you had the first exposure to Github Actions. 
We just checked frontmatter compliance (as we do for this round).
You see that we have added a second action - here, we are converting the Rmarkdown document to a markdown file by running `render_rmarkdown` on Github. This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.


Now start reading ...


Read the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.

Then do:

1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**

2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**

3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the depepndencies or explicilty by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**

4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**

5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**


Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**

Helps with managing R project's dependencies as well managing packages (installing or removing), so that our existing workflows function as they did before. This package represents a robust, stable replacement for the Packrat package.

2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**

Following the workflow went well and the "renv" package was created successfully. All the required packages to run the code for Blog 4 also installed and updated as expected.

Troubleshooting the error "Error: install of package "curl" failed [error code 1]" took some time.
To fix this I needed to install the "libcurl4-openssl-dev" package, but most of the answers indicated the command "sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev". To use "sudo" I needed the Ubuntu aplication installed as well.

I also followed all the steps on this link: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-curl-command-on-a-ubuntu-linux/
