What happens when we change the Rmd file and commit?

In Blog 5 you had the first exposure to Github Actions. 
We just checked frontmatter compliance (as we do for this round).
You see that we have added a second action - here, we are converting the Rmarkdown document to a markdown file by running `render_rmarkdown` on Github. This action passes successfully for this document. We want to do something similar for blog #4.


Now start reading ...


Read the vignette [Introduction to renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for the `renv` R package by Kevin Ushey.

Then do:

1. **Install the R package `renv` on your local machine.**

2. **In the project for blog 4, initialize the workflow used by the `renv` package.**

3. **Add all dependencies to the environment (implicitly by installing all the dependencies or explicitly by listing dependencies in a DESCRIPTION file).**

4. **Add the `renv` folder to your blog 4 repository, and push the changes.**

5. **Is the github action working? Read any potential error messages in the workflow and try to fix things. Make sure to check stackoverflow for help, don't forget our Discussion board!**


Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

1. **What is the idea of the renv package?**

`renv` packages is for managing the dependencies of a project. By using it we can easily save the R version and dependent packages version and restore the environment in the future. This helps with reproducibility of the project.

2. **In 50 to 100 words describe your experience working with `renv`. What went well? What did not go so well?**

I tested 8 rounds to get things right. In the render-rmarkdown.yaml generated by `usethis` package, `setup-r`, `setup-renv` and `setup-pandoc` are in v1, and I get error which says fail to install R as well as other warnings. After I updated these to v2, I started getting error saying there is no package called rmarkdown, which turned out to be caused by not pushing renv.lock to my repo.
