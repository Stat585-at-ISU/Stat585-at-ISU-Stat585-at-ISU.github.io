## Prompt:

GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and
collaboration. It also has several useful features for professional
promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub
pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub
developer profile, and even use
[resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume
summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the
project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)).

posit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to
generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this
assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt
8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)

Describe your experience creating your website below. Don’t forget to
link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure
that all of the checks are passing.

**How did building your own website go?**

This week, we were tasked with building our own website and it was an
interesting task. I have been meaning to build it for sometime but it
has alway been put in the back burner because other tasks took priority
over it. I am glad I finally had a push to do it. Thankfully, I could
count on GitHub pages to help with this task. The fact that we can
upload a website the general structure to a GitHub repository and GitHub
will build a webpage and deploy it, is fascinating. This removes a lot
of the complications that come from bulding websites, as we often have
the answer questions such as: “Where I am going to host this?”; “Should
I configure a database for this website?”; and “How do I configure a
server?”.

Not everything went well though, I had a hard time figuring out how to
build the website using [Jeckyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I was able to
find several Jeckyll templates but I failed to understand how to use
them in GitHub. Eventually, I gave up on Jeckyll. I have had some
previous experience building websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so
I decided to move forward with that. Overall, I had a fun time writing
about myself in a professional website. The hardest part was figuring
out what should I include and what should I not. Finally, I have opted
for a simple layout that communicates all the information I believe a
future employer would be interested. The
[website](https://santos-cl.github.io/) contains a very simple layout
with the following sections:

| Section            | Description                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Welcome            | Brief description of my activities nowadays.                    |
| Profile            | Profile picture and links to social media and curriculum vitae. |
| Research Interests | Research topics I am fascinated about.                          |
| Education          | Universities I have attended.                                   |
| Software           | 1 software I have published…                                    |
| Publications       | Peer-reviewed publications                                      |
