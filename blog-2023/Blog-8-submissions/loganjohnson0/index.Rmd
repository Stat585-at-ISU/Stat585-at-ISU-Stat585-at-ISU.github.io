## Prompt:

GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and collaboration. It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). 

posit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)

Describe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.

**How did building your own website go?**

I genuinely found this activity to be very exciting. I have always wanted to have my own website but I have never fully understood all of the behind the scenes type work that has to go into it. I also thought that in order to have a website that I would have to pay for a domain name or pay for the service of hosting the website. Blog 8 gave me the information needed to begin to develop my own website. I was able to use the Quarto documents online to help guide me through the process of hosting a website, some of the modifications I could make to my website, and connecting the Quarto project to GitHub pages. It was all a very easy process. 

I also took to the [Quarto Gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/#websites) to see some example websites. From these examples, I was able to identify some of the structure that I was looking to incorporate into my website. I also modified some of the color of my page using a .scss file. I'm not certain if I used that file correctly or not because according to GitHub, 98% of my website is coded in SCSS. I'm still learning more about the different styling and language of HTML and CSS, so maybe in the future I can modify those files better than incorporating the SCSS file. Maybe it doesn't matter either way, but I'm hoping to learn more about the styling.

Overall, I was impressed with the ease of use of creating the website. There are many different ways to modify the website and make it unique to each use case that a user might have. I think it also has a nice standard format that makes it consistent. I imagine it is easy to really add even more customization into the website beyond my current knowledge of the system. Some goals I have for my website would be to include an additional section for potentially a blog, an area for packages or other relevant things related to my research, and adjusting the styling and being more creative with that. I also aim to incorporate different pictures into the website or a page showcasing tweets or retweets of mine (I am working on being active on academic twitter).
