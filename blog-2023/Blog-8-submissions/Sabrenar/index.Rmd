## Prompt:

GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and collaboration. It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). 

posit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)

Describe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.

**How did building your own website go?**

The biggest issue I had with creating this website was the lack of documentation. The theme would not update unless it was on the *_site.yml* file despite the individual Rmarkdown files having options for theme. Changing the layout for the pages is cumbersome since the html coding is needed within the Rmarkdown, which is not explicitly mentioned in any documentation. 
After troubleshooting theme display issues, I encountered several issues with connection between the github repo and the website. At one time both the Rmarkdown and the website rendered successfully, but in order to get matching layout and theme between the Rmarkdown render and the website display, I created a css file. Adding this file caused a 404 error when accessing the website, but no issues in the Rmarkdown render. 
I investigated the errors and found a connection issue with github triggered by bug #3345 github bug report website connection (gtritchie. “R Markdown Website Published with Source to RSConnect from Viewer Has Wrong Type · Issue #3345 · RSTUDIO/Rstudio.” GitHub, August 20, 2018. https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/3345. ). The error implies that github cannot find the index.html file, which does not make sense since it is present on the main directory of the github repo.
Overall I found the experience to be tedious and annoying.
