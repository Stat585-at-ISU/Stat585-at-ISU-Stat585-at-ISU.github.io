## Prompt:

GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and collaboration. It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). 

posit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)

Describe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.

**How did building your own website go?**

[Historical Mapping](https://haruncelikotto.github.io/)

I decided to build a Quarto Blog to document the work that I want to do for the 
projects related to historical maps. Quarto's layout is pretty straight-forward so
I didn't run into any problems with creating the posts that are on the webpage. 
I did try to change the css styling of the page a little bit with a new navbar but 
definitely struggled with trying to find the right place to put in the new html styles.
In publishing to the Github Pages, I first decided I would try to work with the `quarto publish`
command but didn't really understand what the purpose of change the source branch to the 
`gh-pages` was so I opted for the docs method instead which was quite easy. It is still a little
scary that you could accidentally push the rest of your code with your docs to the repository by accident
but I suppose there are .gitignore files for a reason.
