## Prompt:

GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and
collaboration. It also has several useful features for professional
promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub
pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub
developer profile, and even use
[resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume
summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the
project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)).

posit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to
generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this
assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt
8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)

**Solution:** It has been a great experience in creating websites and
publish on GitHub. I have learnt a lot how “rmd” and “qmd” file works
and how continuous integration help projects to build and host. It also
helped me to learn yaml file and how it works.
