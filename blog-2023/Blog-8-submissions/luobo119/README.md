## Prompt:

GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and
collaboration. It also has several useful features for professional
promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub
pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub
developer profile, and even use
[resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume
summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the
project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)).

posit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to
generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this
assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt
8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)

Describe your experience creating your website below. Don’t forget to
link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure
that all of the checks are passing.

**How did building your own website go?**

I use Quarto to build my website. Quarto is a very powerful tool to
build a website. It’s very convenient to add content to the website, add
links to other websites, and modify the structure of the website. I
tried a sidebar navigator and it works well. Publishing the website to
GitHub is a little bit confusing, but the description of the methods is
detailed on Quarto website.
