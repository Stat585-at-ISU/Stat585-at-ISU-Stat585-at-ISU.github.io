## Prompt:

GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and collaboration. It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). 

posit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)

Describe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.

**How did building your own website go?**

Building the website was fun and quite easy until I had to commit and push all the files required.
There was a yellow question mark beside the site_libs folder and I tried clicking on it to get the check mark, so I could commit and push.


I kept getting the following error message: 

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.

So I went on my repo and added the files via upload.
My website has three pages: Home, Volunteering Experiences, R Favorite Packages.

In these pages I linked my student bios in different research and professional development projects that I am involved.
I also mentioned Volunteer Experience and packages that I have enjoyed working with or packages that I see value for future work.
