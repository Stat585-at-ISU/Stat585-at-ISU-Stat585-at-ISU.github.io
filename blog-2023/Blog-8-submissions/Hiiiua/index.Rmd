## Prompt:

GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and collaboration. It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). 

posit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)

Describe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.       
    
*My answer*
I have done this when I took STAT 850, but we didn't cover yaml and header structure. This time I found a nice template to add icons for contact, github, blog and etc. There's no doubt the website looks neater than before. I'll share two finding of mine in this github page revisit activity.       
Github page is a nice way to share the `README` file with keeping repo code private. There is always a time I make a nice repo of a project, but I don't want to or I can't share my code yet while I want to shout out to the world about how great is my project, github page is my good friend in this case.        
I didn't know why I need to wait for some time to see my update after refreshing the github.io page two years ago, because I didn't know what does github action do. It was also difficult to tell I failed see the updated webpage because incorrect rendering or just wrong syntax in `README`. I remember it took me a morning to redo the page tab over and over again because I can't find the link in the io page, but turned out it was a little syntax in Rmd file and I passed the workflow. Now I can differentiate by looking at the green check or red cross under the `action` tab, and I can change default md output to html in yaml to fix the rendering problem.
