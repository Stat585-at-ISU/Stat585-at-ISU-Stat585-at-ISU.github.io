## Prompt:

GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for project management and collaboration. It also has several useful features for professional promotion: you can host your own site on github using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), describe yourself using a GitHub developer profile, and even use [resume.github.io](http://resume.github.io/) to generate a resume summary of your activity on GitHub (you must opt-in by [starring the project page](https://github.com/resume/resume.github.com)). 

posit and the associated package infrastructure provide multiple ways to generate websites using Quarto (or Rmarkdown). You can complete this assignment using one of the two options detailed in [Prompt 8](https://stat585-at-isu.github.io/blog-2023/Prompts/Blog-8/Prompt.html)

Describe your experience creating your website below. Don't forget to link to your website! Push this blog post to your blog-8 repo. Make sure that all of the checks are passing.

**How did building your own website go?**

Building a website was really interesting to me. I thought that it should be very complicated, but when I started it was much easier than what I thought. I chose to build my website using Rmarkdown. It was very straight forward, but I experienced a few minor problems during the process. One of them happened when I wanted to push the required initial document to the GitHub. I had some difficulties pushing the site_libs; I finally uploaded this file on my repo manually. Here is the link to [my website](https://atefeha1995.github.io/index.html).:)
I am really excited about it, and I am going to make my website more complete and more beautiful.
