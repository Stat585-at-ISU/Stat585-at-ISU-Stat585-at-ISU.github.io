## Prompt:

The `DESCRIPTION` file of a package contains the package's meta information. Most of the fields in this file are quite straight forward: author, version number, and a short package description. When you call `library(help="<package name>")` for  package `<package name>` you can see the contents of the `DESCRIPTION` file for that package (and some parts of the `NAMESPACE` file).

Read through Colin Fay's (short) book on [Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/)

Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

### Under what license does R operate? What is the license for ggplot2?


- Licenses for R include GPL-2, GPL-3, LGPL-2.1 and LGPL-3.


- From `library(help = "ggplot2")`, we can find the license for `ggplot2` is MIT + file LICENSE.


### What are the dependencies of the package you made?

Read through [chapter 5.2 of Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/practical.html#dependencies-exploration). Combine and adjust the code pieces to create the dependencies for a package that is on github rather than CRAN. (Don't forget about the package `desc`.) What dependencies does the package have that you created for Lab-3? 
Which licenses are involved? 
Are all of these dependencies required? Elaborate.

- I check the dependencies for package `litr` on github, there are 90 dependencies:

R6, askpass, base64enc, bookdown, brew, brio, bslib, cachem, callr, cli, clipr, commonmark, crayon, credentials, curl, desc, devtools, diffobj, digest, downlit, ellipsis, evaluate, fansi, fastmap, fs, gert, gh, gitcreds, glue, grDevices, graphics, highr, htmltools, httr, ini, jquerylib, jsonlite, knitr, lifecycle, litr, magrittr, memoise, methods, mime, openssl, pillar, pkgbuild, pkgconfig, pkgdown, pkgload, praise, prettyunits, processx, ps, purrr, ragg, rappdirs, rcmdcheck, rematch2, remotes, rlang, rmarkdown, roxygen2, rprojroot, rstudioapi, rversions, sass, sessioninfo, stats, stringi, stringr, sys, systemfonts, testthat, textshaping, tibble, tinytex, tools, usethis, utf8, utils, vctrs, waldo, whisker, withr, xfun, xml2, xopen, yaml, zip.

Not everything in `litr_dep` is found in cran database. Packages `grDevice`, `graphics`, `methods`, `stats`, `tools` and `utils` are now base packages so not listed in cran. I'm not sure why `litr` has itself as dependency.


- The dependencies for Lab 3, there are 111:

DBI, MASS, Matrix, PressLogTeamUNL, R6, RColorBrewer, Rcpp, askpass, assertthat, backports, base64enc, bit, bit64, blob, broom, bslib, callr, cellranger, cli, clipr, colorspace, crayon, curl, data.table, dbplyr, digest, dplyr, dtplyr, ellipsis, evaluate, fansi, farver, fastmap, forcats, fs, gargle, generics, ggplot2, glue, googledrive, googlesheets4, grDevices, graphics, grid, gtable, haven, highr, hms, htmltools, httr, ids, isoband, jquerylib, jsonlite, knitr, labeling, lattice, lifecycle, lubridate, magrittr, methods, mgcv, mime, modelr, munsell, nlme, openssl, pillar, pkgconfig, png, processx, ps, purrr, rJava, rappdirs, readr, readxl, rematch, rematch2, reprex, rlang, rmarkdown, rstudioapi, rvest, sass, scales, selectr, splines, stats, stringi, stringr, sys, tabulizer, tabulizerjars, tibble, tidyr, tidyselect, tidyverse, tinytex, tools, tzdb, utf8, utils, uuid, vctrs, viridisLite, vroom, withr, xfun, xml2, yaml.

Not all the dependencies are needed. I think part of them are listed because we listed `tidyverse` as a dependency, which can be replaced by `dplyr`.

### Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

- No as GPL-3 license is more restrictive than MIT license.

In section 3.1.2 in Colin Fay's book Licensing R, it is stated that "any derivative work of GPL licensed work is to be licensed under GPL-compatible license" according to FSF. Depending on other packages should form a dynamic linking, and in most cases, be considered as a single combined program, then the GPL license is required.

In Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's R package (2e) book, they mention:

```
Before you bundle someone elseâ€™s code into your package, you need to first check that the bundled license is compatible with your license. When distributing code, you can add additional restrictions, but you can not remove restrictions, which means that license compatibility is not symmetric. For example, you can bundle MIT licensed code in a GPL licensed package, but you can not bundle GPL licensed code in an MIT licensed package.
```

When confronted with the above question, ChatGPT gave two -- quite different -- responses, as shown below. 
The main point in both responses is 'your package may be considered  derivative work'. At the specific problem of the package developed for Lab 3, what is your opinion about potential copyright infringements when releasing the package with an MIT license? Make sure to take the relevant passage in Colin Fay's book under consideration.

```
The legal implications of publishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 are complex and can vary depending on the specific circumstances. It is always advisable to seek legal advice from a licensed attorney if you have any doubts or concerns about licensing issues.

However, in general, it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3. This is because the MIT license is a permissive open-source license that allows for more flexibility in how the software can be used and distributed, and it is generally considered compatible with the GPL-3 license.

That being said, if your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore subject to the terms of the GPL-3 license. This means that if you distribute your package, you may need to also distribute the source code for your package under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license, and you may need to ensure that the requirements of the GPL-3 license are met for the entire distribution, including any dependencies.

It is also worth noting that the R community has its own guidelines and recommendations for package licensing, and it is important to comply with these guidelines if you want to publish your package on CRAN. The CRAN Repository Policy states that packages should have a "permissive" or "GPL-compatible" license, but does not explicitly require that packages use the GPL license or any other specific license.

In summary, while it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, it is important to understand the implications of the different licenses and to ensure that you comply with any applicable guidelines and recommendations from the R community.
```

After harping a bit on copyright infringement in general, ChatGPT changed its response to

```
Technically, you can publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, but doing so would not be compliant with the terms of the GPL-3 license.

The GPL-3 license is a strong copyleft license that requires derivative works to be released under the same license. If your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore must be licensed under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license.

The MIT license, on the other hand, is a permissive license that allows for more flexibility in how the software is used and distributed. However, it is not compatible with the GPL-3 license, and therefore cannot be used for derivative works of GPL-3-licensed software.

Publishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 would be a licensing violation, and could potentially result in legal action or other consequences. It is important to comply with the licensing requirements of all dependencies in your package to avoid any legal issues.
```

The 'harping' questions:

- Is it legal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

- Is it illegal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

- Is it a copyright infringement to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

- Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 without infringing copyright?
