## Prompt:

The `DESCRIPTION` file of a package contains the package's meta information. Most of the fields in this file are quite straight forward: author, version number, and a short package description. When you call `library(help="<package name>")` for  package `<package name>` you can see the contents of the `DESCRIPTION` file for that package (and some parts of the `NAMESPACE` file).

Read through Colin Fay's (short) book on [Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/)

Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

### Under what license does R operate? What is the license for ggplot2?

Parvin's answer: R software is a free software which was released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, either version 2 (June 1991) or version 3 (June 2007). I used the "licence()" in the R and could get it. ggplot2 package is distributed based on the MIT + file License. 

### What are the dependencies of the package you made?

Read through [chapter 5.2 of Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/practical.html#dependencies-exploration). Combine and adjust the code pieces to create the dependencies for a package that is on github rather than CRAN. (Don't forget about the package `desc`.) What dependencies does the package have that you created for Lab-3? 
Which licenses are involved? 
Are all of these dependencies required? Elaborate.

Parvin's answer: Unfortunately, I could not get the dependencies for out team's package (Team 6) beacuse of one issue in importing the package. So, I tried to get the dependencoes and run the code on the package of another team which is named "AmesPD" from "Team1". 
For the first part using the get_deps function, I got:
```
INFO [2023-03-09 16:10:54] Constructing dependency network for Team1
INFO [2023-03-09 16:10:54] ...done constructing dependency network.
```

For the next part, I got:
```
New names:
• `Authors@R` -> `Authors.R`
• `Classification/ACM` -> `Classification.ACM`
• `Classification/ACM-2012` -> `Classification.ACM.2012`
• `Classification/JEL` -> `Classification.JEL`
• `Classification/MSC` -> `Classification.MSC`
• `Classification/MSC-2010` -> `Classification.MSC.2010`
• `Date/Publication` -> `Date.Publication`
• `X-CRAN-Comment` -> `X.CRAN.Comment`
• `Reverse depends` -> `Reverse.depends`
• `Reverse imports` -> `Reverse.imports`
• `Reverse linking to` -> `Reverse.linking.to`
• `Reverse suggests` -> `Reverse.suggests`
• `Reverse enhances` -> `Reverse.enhances`
```

For the next part, I got:

```

8 file LICENSE                               1
```



In this way, we can get the dependencies of the package that we made in the lab or any package which is available in Github.

Under which license should this blog post be published? Make sure that you are using an appropriate license. (You can change the current licenses with the help of commands from the `use_license_XXX` family in the `usethis` package)

For this blog, we are using the license cc0-1.0; I am gonna keep this license. 


### Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

When confronted with the above question, ChatGPT gave two -- quite different -- responses, as shown below. 
The main point in both responses is 'your package may be considered  derivative work'. At the specific problem of the package developed for Lab 3, what is your opinion about potential copyright infringements when releasing the package with an MIT license? Make sure to take the relevant passage in Colin Fay's book under consideration.

Parvin's answer: My understanding from the Colin Fay's book was that a package which is licensed under GPL-3 is compatible and accepted by the CRAN policy. Therefore, it is possible to publish it in CRAN but it needs the permission of the all the contributors. The conversation and permission announcement may happen in the Github between the contributors. I just mentioned the points that was said in the book and it was not said in the following information from ChatGPT.


```
The legal implications of publishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 are complex and can vary depending on the specific circumstances. It is always advisable to seek legal advice from a licensed attorney if you have any doubts or concerns about licensing issues.

However, in general, it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3. This is because the MIT license is a permissive open-source license that allows for more flexibility in how the software can be used and distributed, and it is generally considered compatible with the GPL-3 license.

That being said, if your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore subject to the terms of the GPL-3 license. This means that if you distribute your package, you may need to also distribute the source code for your package under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license, and you may need to ensure that the requirements of the GPL-3 license are met for the entire distribution, including any dependencies.

It is also worth noting that the R community has its own guidelines and recommendations for package licensing, and it is important to comply with these guidelines if you want to publish your package on CRAN. The CRAN Repository Policy states that packages should have a "permissive" or "GPL-compatible" license, but does not explicitly require that packages use the GPL license or any other specific license.

In summary, while it is possible to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license while having a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, it is important to understand the implications of the different licenses and to ensure that you comply with any applicable guidelines and recommendations from the R community.
```

After harping a bit on copyright infringement in general, ChatGPT changed its response to

```
Technically, you can publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3, but doing so would not be compliant with the terms of the GPL-3 license.

The GPL-3 license is a strong copyleft license that requires derivative works to be released under the same license. If your package depends on a GPL-3-licensed package, your package may be considered a derivative work and therefore must be licensed under the GPL-3 license or a compatible license.

The MIT license, on the other hand, is a permissive license that allows for more flexibility in how the software is used and distributed. However, it is not compatible with the GPL-3 license, and therefore cannot be used for derivative works of GPL-3-licensed software.

Publishing an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when you have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 would be a licensing violation, and could potentially result in legal action or other consequences. It is important to comply with the licensing requirements of all dependencies in your package to avoid any legal issues.
```

The 'harping' questions:

- Is it legal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

- Is it illegal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

- Is it a copyright infringement to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

- Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 without infringing copyright?
