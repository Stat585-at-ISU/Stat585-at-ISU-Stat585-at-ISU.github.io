## Prompt:

The `DESCRIPTION` file of a package contains the package's meta information. Most of the fields in this file are quite straight forward: author, version number, and a short package description. When you call `library(help="<package name>")` for  package `<package name>` you can see the contents of the `DESCRIPTION` file for that package (and some parts of the `NAMESPACE` file).

Read through Colin Fay's (short) book on [Licensing R](https://thinkr-open.github.io/licensing-r/)

Write a blog post addressing the following questions: 

### Under what license does R operate? What is the license for ggplot2?

R is licensed as GNU General Public License. R as a package is licensed under GPL-2 | GPL-3. The ggplot2 license is MIT + file LICENSE. 


### What are the dependencies of the package you made?

library(lubridate, quietly = TRUE)   GPL (>= 2)
library(tabulizer)    MIT + file LICENSE
library(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE)   MIT + file LICENSE
library(stringr)  MIT + file LICENSE

Are packages we used. 

Under which license should this blog post be published? Make sure that you are using an appropriate license. 
I would use MIT + file LICENSE because it does not matter if someone modifies anything. 

### Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?

I would say yes you can publish a package on CRAN under an MIT license but it might not be technically following the rules. 

The 'harping' questions:

- Is it legal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?
No?
- Is it illegal to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?
No?
- Is it a copyright infringement to publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3?
Yes
- Can I publish an R package on CRAN under an MIT license when I have a dependency on a package that is licensed under GPL-3 without infringing copyright?
No

The licensing was a little confusing. It almost sounds like it isn't very explicitly defined so it isn't legal, but also not illegal. I'm not sure I understood the licensing very well.
