## Prompt:

Fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it.

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible.

Describe your experience below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.

**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**

*my answer*

The warning message from the item I fixed is  
`❯ checking dependencies in R code ... WARNING   '::' or ':::' import not declared from: ‘purrr’`

This must results from using a function from \`purrr\` package with import missing, so I went to the R code, spotted the function with code `purrr::` . In the function defined there, I added one line with `#' @import purrr`, ran the function `devtool::document` to make sure \`NAMESPACE\` is properly updated, I also update `Imports` in `DESCRIPTION`.

This is an easy warning to fixed as long as familiarizing with the documentation process in R package and being able to find the function loaded the package.
