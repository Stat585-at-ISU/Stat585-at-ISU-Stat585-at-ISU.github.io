## Prompt:

Fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. 

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. 
The following was the warning i got 


get_pd_presslog: no visible global function definition for
    'download.file'
  get_presslog: no visible binding for global variable 'presslog_ames'
  get_presslog: no visible global function definition for 'ymd'
  get_presslog: no visible global function definition for '%>%'
  get_presslog: no visible global function definition for 'filter'
  get_presslog: no visible binding for global variable
    'Call_Received_Date'
  pdf_to_tbl: no visible global function definition for 'extract_tables'
  pdf_to_tbl: no visible global function definition for '%>%'
  pdf_to_tbl: no visible global function definition for 'separate'
  pdf_to_tbl: no visible binding for global variable
    'Call_Received_Date_Time'
  pdf_to_tbl: no visible global function definition for 'write.csv'
  pdf_to_tbl: no visible global function definition for 'as_tibble'
  Undefined global functions or variables:
    %>% Call_Received_Date Call_Received_Date_Time as_tibble
    download.file extract_tables filter presslog_ames separate write.csv
    ymd
  Consider adding
    importFrom("stats", "filter")
    importFrom("utils", "download.file", "write.csv")
  to your NAMESPACE file.
  
The way i fixed the error was to add the following  to Namespace file 
    importFrom("stats", "filter")
    importFrom("utils", "download.file", "write.csv")
    



I fixed the error in the following manner: 
   
    1) I ran series of checks on the Team3 package using the devtools::check() to produce the error. 
    
    2) Once the issue was identified, I observed that it was missing some import function on the name space file.
   
    3) To fix this warning message, I added importFrom() statements to the NAMESPACE file. These statements tell R which functions and variables from other packages are needed. In my case, I added importFrom() statements for the filter, download.file, and write.csv functions from the stats and utils packages.


Describe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes


Although fixing the namespace issues can be challenging in R, it is an important step in developing a well-functioning and properly organized package. The goal of namespace management is to ensure that each function in your package can access the functions and the variables it needs from other packages, without polluting the global environment or causing conflicts with other packages. A key challenge I faced was to ensure that all the packages were correctly imported and defined. It was helpful that after making all the changes, there was a tool to recheck if there were any errors.  

**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**
