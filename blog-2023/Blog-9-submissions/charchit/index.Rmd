## Prompt:

Fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. 

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. 

Describe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.

**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**
Fixed the warning for Team 3. While installing the team 3 package, it was giving warning for Rcurl function we used to read the URL, when we first started working on "lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all". So after adding the @import packages in description file,  and importing all and updates in the namespace file the warnings were eliminated. Then later on while installing the package, it was giving warning that stat::filter was replacing the dplyr::filter. So we used dplyr::filter instead of "filter" to remove the stat::filter warning when installing the package.

Experience: Fixing this was more frustrating than writing the code the first time. Specially when we wrote the code as a team. I forgot a lot of the things we did when building the package first time. Reproducibility seems very important even when working on a small project like this. I watched the lectures again to recall what we did and how Dr. Hofmann fixed some things in the class. The challenge is, it takes more time to document all the things we have done. It is a combination of laziness and calling some things just "good enough" and move on, instead of willing to sit down and write the documentation. I definitely think it is more important to document and write the things we have done during the code, hopefully I can change my habit of documenting as I go along in my research. Thanks for introducing this.
