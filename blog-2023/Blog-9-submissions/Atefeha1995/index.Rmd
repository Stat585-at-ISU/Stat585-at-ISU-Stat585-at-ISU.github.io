## Prompt:

Fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. 

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. 

Describe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.

**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**

**For team 4**, I ran check("Team4"), and this was the result:

`❯ checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
Namespaces in Imports field not imported from:
  'readr' 'stringr'
All declared Imports should be used.`

0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 1 note ✖


So, I changed the Imports set in Description file, and omitted 'readr' and 'stringr'.
It seems that these packages were not required. Here is the new result for check("Team4") command:

0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 0 notes ✔


**For Team6**, When I ran document("Team6"), I got this error message:

`> document("Team6")
ℹ Updating Team6 documentation
ℹ Loading Team6
Warning message:
[press_log_data.R:15] @source requires a value `

Then I went to press_log_data.R file, and I checked row number 15.
It seems that they forgot to add an appropriate source there. So, I added the source of the data there. Then, I ran the command one more time and the problem has been solved.

`> document("Team6")
ℹ Updating Team6 documentation
ℹ Loading Team6
Writing press_log_data.Rd`


This was the note when I ran check("Team6"):

`❯ checking top-level files ... NOTE
Non-standard files/directories found at top level:
 'presslog-20230306.csv' 'presslog_amespd_2023-03-06.pdf'`

0 errors ✔ | 1 warning ✖ | 1 note ✖


I deleted those two extra files (presslog-20230306.csv and presslog_amespd_2023-03-06.pdf), and the note has been removed.

0 errors ✔ | 1 warning ✖ | 0 notes ✔


**For Team2**, when I ran check("Team2"), I got this error:

`> check("Team2")
ℹ Updating Team2 documentation
ℹ Loading Team2
Error: 'ames_presslog' is not an exported object from 'namespace:Team2'`

I checked and found that 'ames_presslog' is not exported in namespace, and it is not in man files. So, I deleted the 'ames_presslog.R' from the R folder, and it's data from the Data folder. Then, I ran check() command again, and this was the result:

 0 errors ✔ | 4 warnings ✖ | 2 notes ✖  
  
this was one of the warning messages:

`❯ checking Rd \usage sections ... WARNING
Undocumented arguments in documentation object 'get_presslog'
'date.column'
Functions with \usage entries need to have the appropriate \alias
entries, and all their arguments documented.
The \usage entries must correspond to syntactically valid R code.
See chapter 'Writing R documentation files' in the 'Writing R
 Extensions' manual.`


considering the message I went to the get_presslog.R file in the R folder of the Team2 package, and I added the date.column which is one of the inputs for the get_presslog function, as a parameter using the command line below.

`#' @param date.column The column which contains the Date and time`

I saved the changes, and checked it again. The number of warnings was reduced to 3.

0 errors ✔ | 3 warnings ✖ | 2 notes ✖
