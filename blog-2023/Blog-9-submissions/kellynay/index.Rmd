## Prompt:

Fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. 

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. 

Describe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.

**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**

I worked with my Lab3 - Team 3 colleagues to fix some of the issues highlighted by Ganesh when he graded our lab assignment.

Exact warning message:
Warning: replacing previous import 'dplyr::filter' by 'stats::filter' when loading 'Team3' ** testing if installed package can be loaded from final location 
Warning: replacing previous import 'dplyr::filter' by 'stats::filter' when loading 'Team3' ** testing if installed package keeps a record of temporary installation path


The get_presslog function was throwing a warning due to the following (Line 19 in get_presslog.R):

- data_subset <- data %>% filter(Call_Received_Date >= from2) %>% filter(Call_Received_Date <= to2)

We fixed the error by doing: 

- data_subset <- data %>% dplyr::filter(Call_Received_Date >= from2) %>% dplyr::filter(Call_Received_Date <= to2)

In summary, we replaced 'stats::filter' by 'dplyr::filter'.

We also addressed this issue in the NAMESPACE file by writing on Line 12:
importFrom("stats", "filter")
