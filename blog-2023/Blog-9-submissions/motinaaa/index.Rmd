## Prompt:

Fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. 

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. 

Describe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.

**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**

Firstly, I did eeny meeny miny moe to pick a number, got 5, so I checked Team5 package:))

I ran the `check()`, No warnings or errors, just some notes I saw.
First note said `all declared imports should be used`.
So I went to the description file and removed the mentioned packages from imports. Easy-peasy, fixed that note.

Next note was about `missing dependencies to other packages`.
Checked the .R code, and I added the dependencies in the description file under imports. Sorted!

Another note was about considering adding `importFrom("stats","filter")`.
Addressed this by going to the .R file and adding `dplyr::` before `filter` function.
Then added `@importFrom dplyr filter` in the beginning of the file.
After that, ran `document()` to build them in the `NAMESPACE` file and then ran `check()`.
Fixed a bunch of these notes too!

Then I tackled the `global bindings` and added `"Variable_Name" <- "Variable_Name" <- NULL` to the addressed functions.
Tadaaaaa, green checkmarks all around for Team 5! Woohoo!

I think I was supposed to fix just one of these notes, but my OCD kicked in and I ended up fixing them all. Just wanted to see those green marks! ðŸ˜…
