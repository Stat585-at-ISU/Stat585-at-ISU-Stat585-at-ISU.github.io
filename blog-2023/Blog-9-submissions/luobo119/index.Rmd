## Prompt:

Fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. 

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. 

Describe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.

**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**

Warning from Team2:

  checkRd: (5) presslog_ames.Rd:0-29: Must have a \\description

This warning can be fixed by adding '}' in presslog_ames.R. There is one '}' missing for '\\describe'.

- checking dependencies in R code ... WARNING

    ‘tabulizer’ ‘tidyverse’
    
  'library' or 'require' calls in package code:

Adding '@importFrom tabulizer extract_tables' and deleting 'library('tidyverse')' and 'library('tabulizer')' in the function in pdf_to_tbl.R.
