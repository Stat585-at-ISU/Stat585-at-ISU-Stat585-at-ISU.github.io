## Prompt:

Fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. 

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. 

The exact warning message: Warning message: Expected 2 pieces. Missing pieces filled with `NA` in 50 rows [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, ...].
I referenced the separate function's documentation. Since the warning from a result from not finding 2 pieces for the separate function, I found the parameter that controls what the function does if it does not find the expected number of pieces. I then edited the line using the separate function such that the function now has a fill parameter that does not give a warning on default.

Describe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.

Fixing these errors was straight-forward since I knew where the errors were coming from. I have used the separate function frequently so I recognized the warning message.

**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**

Please see the above answer.
