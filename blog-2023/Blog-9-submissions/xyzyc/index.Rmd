## Prompt:

Fix one of the problems in one of our community packages at `https://github.com/Stat585-at-ISU/lab-3-all-all-for-one-and-one-for-all`, and write about it. 

## Instructions:

What we want to know is the **exact** warning or error message of the item you fixed, and a description of what you did, also as specific as possible. 

Describe your experience  below. Push this blog post to your blog-9 repo. Make sure the front matter check passes.

**Which error or warning did you fix? ... and how?**

Before the spring break, I fixed several things for TeamUNL:

- By adding `^presslog.*\.pdf$` to the .RBuildignore file, the `check` function will ignore the pdf files in the R package folder.

- I created a global.R file in the R folder inside the package, and write a line `utils::globalVariables(c("presslog_ames"))` to avoid the global variable binding problem. The package passed the check with no problems. In this blog, I switched to the method used in class, i.e., add `presslog_ames <- NULL` and `data(presslog_ames, envir  = enviroment())` to the function, and specify `importFrom utils data`.


- Fix the dependencies by writing appropriate `importFrom` argument in front of the functions.

In this blog, when I try function call `get_presslog ("2023-02-14", to = "2023-02-14")`, I get error "character string is not in a standard unambiguous format". The function `get_presslog` is written for `presslog_ames.rda` where the `Call Received Date/Time` is a date object. However, the `Call Received Date/Time` in the current file is character. So I updated the dataset.
