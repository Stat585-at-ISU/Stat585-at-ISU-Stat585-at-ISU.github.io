## Prompt:


The goal of this  week's blog is to document what you are doing when things do not go according to plan. 

Similar to previous exercises, we have a specific use case in mind: we want to build a book from a github repository. 

What happens in practice usually, is that we run into some problems. 
So your real task turns into that of a bug-hunter and fixer. Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. 



### What we want: build a book

Build the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.

Steps:

1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.
2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.
3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.
4. The book will be available in html format as index.html

**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. 

Class is the last word on chapter 15.

### What to do when things don't work?

Errors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.

- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. 

- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)

- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).

- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions > Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. 

- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own does not count!). 


**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)

My biggest problem when I was building this book was the error below:

Error: bookdown::render_book() failed to render the output format 'bookdown::pdf_book'

From the beginning, whenever I encountered an error, I searched for it on the internet and the discussion board in Canvas. I found the answer to all my questions except this last one. But I couldn't find the answer to this error using the internet or Canvas. To my knowledge, the book can not be built in pdf format. So, I needed to change the output format, but I was not sure how. I started trying different things in order to change the output format; I searched for it, and finally, I was able to choose bookdown::bs4_book from the Build Book tab in the upright corner of R studio. I was finally able to build the book in HTML format, and I am so happy about it. Generally, that was a great experience for me to build a book from a repo in R studio.

You can write your experience directly into the `README.Rmd` file. Just make sure that you change the yaml at the top: change the author at the top, and give your post a new title (don't change the category :)) 

Commit and push to your repo and you are done!
