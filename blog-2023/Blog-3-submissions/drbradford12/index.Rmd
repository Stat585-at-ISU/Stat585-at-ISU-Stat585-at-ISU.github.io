## Prompt:


The goal of this  week's blog is to document what you are doing when things do not go according to plan. 

Similar to previous exercises, we have a specific use case in mind: we want to build a book from a github repository. 

What happens in practice usually, is that we run into some problems. 
So your real task turns into that of a bug-hunter and fixer. Luckily, you have a community (the class discussion board) who might be able to help you. 



### What we want: build a book

Build the html version of the 2nd edition for Hadley Wickham's book `Advanced R Programming` from a github repository.

Steps:

1. Clone the repository `https://github.com/hadley/adv-r`.
2. Open the R project in the repository in RStudio.
3. Activate the `Build` tab (by default in the top right panel). Click on the `Build Book` button.
4. The book will be available in html format as index.html

**Deliverable (1):** what is the last word in chapter 15? - You don't have to answer this question, if things don't work. 

Denise's Answer:

The last word in chapter 15 is `Python`, while this is the last word in the exercise but I believe that the last word in the chapter before the exercise is `update`, this doesn't include code in the last parts of the chapter.


### What to do when things don't work?

Errors happen, they are frustrating, but if we learn something from them, we can turn them into valuable experiences.

- check the Questions and Answers forum in Canvas whether there is a solution available for your problem. 

- if the above document does (not yet) include your question, document the error you encounter (be as concise and specific as you can at the same time)

- if the Question and Answers forum does (not yet) include a solution, describe one approach on how you tried to solve the problem (and how this did not work).

- submit the description of your problem in Canvas at Discussions > Questions and Answers.  Write the paragraph in the mindset that you want to get help from somebody, and you try to describe the problem you are encountering. 

- Extra points (1 pt for the first suggested working solution): post a solution to one of the problems in the Questions and Answers forum (your own does not count!). 


**Deliverable (2):** Write a paragraph on the biggest problem you encountered when you were building the book, (and how you managed to solve it.)

Denise's Answer:
The biggest problem that I encountered when trying to build the book was the following error:

```
---
Quitting from lines 4-5 (Introduction.Rmd) 
Error in get(genname, envir = envir) : object 'wrap' not found
Calls: local ... withVisible -> eval -> eval -> registerS3method -> get
Execution halted
Error in Rscript_render(f, render_args, render_meta, add1, add2) : 
  Failed to compile Introduction.Rmd
Calls: local ... <Anonymous> -> render_new_session -> Rscript_render
Execution halted
Error: bookdown::render_book() failed to render the output format 'bookdown::bs4_book'.
Execution halted
---
```

The first few attempts to solve the problem was to look for the errors that were being displayed in the `Build` window. Following a few unsuccessful google searchs, I decided to look further into the displayed method. The message is having an issue in the `Introduction.Rmd` looking for a missing `wrap` object. I added the following `webshot::install_phantomjs( force = TRUE)`, which was not helpful in building the book. The situation was in the libraries that were needed in the packages in order to make sure that the information complied. Lastly, I decided to complete the following to get the bookdown to work

You can write your experience directly into the `README.Rmd` file. Just make sure that you change the yaml at the top: change the author at the top, and give your post a new title (don't change the category :)) 

Commit and push to your repo and you are done!
