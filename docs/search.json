    "text": "R Help Community Question\nThe actual question from R Help Community: Make dynamic inputs related to each other?\nIm trying to make an application, and one functionality I would like is to have inputs that dynamically update each other!\nto explain this a bit further, I would like to have a functionality where you can have a raw value, a percentile, and a letter grade, and that all 3 show up on the original page of inputs!\nso when you put in the input for the raw value, it will show the letter grade and the percentile on that same page dynamically, and when you put in the percentile it will update the raw value and letter grade on that page\nideally I could do this with the grade as well (so an A will correspond to a 93rd percentile value, an A- to a 90th percentile value, and putting that in, in a dropdown sense, would update the Raw value and letter grade on the same page to those corresponding values)\njust wondering how I could go about this?!\nMy answer My response could be much clearer if I made an example for every possible outcome of using the UI Dynamically but the previous response linked to the Mastering Shiny R book, chapter 10. As chapter 10 may have been the starting place, suggesting Chapter 15 was at an attempt to allow the user to understand more about the UI being reactive when changed. Or in the event that the UI is not what they were actually looking for in their response to their question.\nPros: - The person asked a question that was important and specific to Shiny. - The person knows enough to be detailed in the outcome\nCons: - The person who posted the question failed to ask a question that was specific with an example. As a result, it would be hard to make the best recommendation. - We don’t know what the data look like"

According to stackoverflow’s Asking a good question page, authors should “explain how [they] encountered the problem [they are] trying to solve, and any difficulties that have prevented [them] from solving it [themselves].” Yet, the author of this particular question appears to only have attemptted installing twice before giving up. They go on to say “Any package I try to install raises the same issue,” which cannot be true since the error message is specific to the package and its dependencies. As such, I’m not sure if their question was helpful to resolving their issue, since there seemed to issues with not having admin rights that was complicating the installation process. In conclusion, I don’t think this question should have been posted on StackOverflow and should have been directed to the author’s IT department.\n\nInstructions to follow."

Then, I located the question that I answered above which is a relatively easy question. By reading the title of this question, I could easily get what they want to know, and based on my knowledge of R and ggplot2 package, it is easy for me to come up with an illustration that used ggplot() and geom_line() to plot multiple lines in the same plot. After I finished my solution, I came back to the stackoverflow page and read through others’ solutions. It turned out that there are many different ways of drawing two graphs in the same plot that I have not used before. Their ideas really helped me and provided me with more tools in my future R experience.\n\n\nInstructions to follow."

As a result, my answer is also provided under the question\nRelate your experience of answering the question to your reading. \n\nMy experience of answering the question based on the reading. When I had answered this question, I was not aware of the correct way to ask questions. Based on the readings, the question asked meets the first criterion for a good question, which is that the question should be on topic and suitable to the Stackoverflow website.The portal Stackoverflow invites questions about programming and the question asked met this requirement. The second requirement is to research and search the existing set of questions to ensure that the question you intend to ask is not duplicated. Although the questioner (which, in this case, was me) had researched and searched the existing set of questions to look for a suitable answer, there is no proof provided to indicate that the question was not repeated/duplicated. The questioner had not linked any seemingly similar questions on this topic existing on the portal. It could also be that there were no such questions. Thereafter, another requirement is that the title of the question summarizes the specific problem faced by the researcher. This condition is not met by the questioner as the title could appear a vague and ambiguous to those attempting to answer the question, although the question itself carries some details, if not all. This is why the person attempting to answer this question asked counterquestions for further clarification. While offering clarification to the question, I stumbled upon the answer myself and answered it on the portal as user13073332. With this experience of asking and answering questions, I learned the importance of providing all possible details required to answer the questions satisfactorily. A question that is clear begets answers whereas one that is unclear only invites further questions. I would also like to link another question I had answered on R help. In this case, the questioner was not me but I had provided the answer under the name “Sudi”.\nThe title of the question is not clear to the extent that there is no indication that it may be a question related to R as required by the guidelines of the portal. However, the person asking the question provides all the required information as part of the question, albeit leaving room for grammatical correction. No vignettes or code demonstrations were provided. The questioner did not allude to other similar questions on the portal or their search about such questions. As I was the second person answering this question, I had help in the form of the answer from the person who had attempted the question before me. Their answer had code information, which was useful while providing an answer.\n\nInstructions to follow."

    "text": "Blog Post - Landon Getting\nWhile trying to identify a question to answer, I was surprised at the rate of response to most of the posted questions on StackOverflow. Many of the trivial, popular, or generic questions were answered in around 20 minutes. By the time I was done crafting my response, there had already been an accepted answer. However, I went back a few days and found an interesting unanswered question. I answered “How to plot the effects of various explanatory variables on the response variable” on StackOverflow.\nPlotting data in many dimensions can be a difficult task and it made sense why this question was unanswered. In my limited experience, there is not a widely accepted and general method for this type of visual. I did some ‘search and research’ as suggested in “How do I ask a good question?” and came up wanting more - as the author of the question likely did. I think the author could have been more precise with their title. Something along the lines of “Plotting Effect of Predictors in MLR on Response Variable?” However, the post was overall short and to the point. I also would have liked to see some data provided to help generate examples. I created a quick shiny app to show how an interactive solution may be useful in addition to a simple column graph for relative comparison of the effects."

So if I were that person, I would have first looked elsewhere.\nThe question asker also could have done a little better with include all relevant code in order to answer their solution. They included just the part that was giving them trouble, when a document class and some of the packages being used would have been helpful. I assumed they were working on an article as it is the most common, but the answer should apply across all classes.\nIf I could talk to them face-to-face, I would have pointed them to other sources (i.e. Overleaf) for most of their questions, since their documentation is really good for quick-access LaTeX questions. If they were also working in somehting like R with a Quarto document, I know Quarto’s website also has a plethora of knowledge.\nOne thing the readings did not tell you is that answering on StackOverflow is SO SCARY like I haven’t been as stressed out about anything before. Like, what is too little to add? Is saying that `{python} ` (without the space) is another way to quickly access Python in a .Rmd document, when someone already spoke about the code you can run in a R session with the ‘reticulate’ package? Also I was and still am afraid that I made a mistake with my answer and it is wrong or not what they needed and then my answer will get down-voted to the deepest depths.\nI’m just too timid to ask questions on StackOverflow, but also too timid to answer them.\n\n\nInstructions to follow."

The included code was also relevant to the issue at hand, and extraneous details were omitted. As a result, I was able to test out similar code myself with a sample program to determine whether my solution was plausible. Additionally, I was able to compare my solution with related questions and answers presented by other StackOverflow users. However, the asker did not provide the specific R package they used to fit their model. Hence, I was unable to know for sure whether the issue was related to the data in their test matrix or if it was instead an issue with the way they were using a certain package. The question only included small amounts of code and a brief description of the issue. Additionally, no comments were included for the code that was included, which made it difficult to understand all lines of code with this package that I was seemingly unfamiliar with. Fortunately, the problem appeared to be quite self-explanatory and required few additional details. When answering the question, I asked for additional clarification on the R package that they used so that myself or another user can provide a more detailed solution (if my solution does not solve their issue). The problem should then be easily solved by another user who has a greater degree of familiarity with the associated package.\n\nInstructions to follow."

It was very helpful that the OP provided their code with the question. However, the OP’s code used a dataset that was not built into R and the OP did not include code to create the dataset for the plot. This broke one of the guidelines for minimal reproducible examples. Fortunately, the requested plot was simple enough that I could recreate the issue using the built-in iris dataset in R. The problem turned out to be that the OP wanted to use the fill aesthetic to change the color of the bars on the plot via scale_fill_manual but did not have anything mapped to the fill aesthetic. In my answer, I provided an example very similar to the OP’s code, except I used the iris dataset with the variable Species mapped to the x aesthetic to define the bars and also mapped Species to the fill aesthetic so I could use scale_fill_manual to change the colors of the bars."

I also appreciated the informative titles of questions. Both helped me quickly assess if a question was something I could solve using my own experience and made me want to answer their questions more, making clear to me why the readings have such guidelines for posting questions.\nThe question I chose to answer was relatively simple with only 6 lines of code. However, when trying to answer their question, I realized that their example was not reproducible for others because they didn’t include a dataset that corresponded to their variable in the code. I ended up creating my own little example to try to understand what their issue was. In doing so, I also realized that, as the readings said, making a minimal reproducible example isn’t always that hard and that trying to make one can help you think through your bug as well.\n\nInstructions to follow."

The question I answered was this one about using a list of variables in a loop in R. My username is HarunCelikOtto and is chronologically the second answer to the question.\nI think that after reading the advice by Stack Overflow’s “How do I ask a good question?” I came to better understand why I had trouble understanding the question that the user posted on the forum. While the inquirer added some example code about what data they were working with, they didn’t elaborate on the outcome that was expected of the corrected code. For this reason, another user and myself had to assume what the intended output had to be. While the user may find my answer helpful, maybe it isn’t exactly the result that they want because the objective was unclear. Looking through questions, I’ve come to the realization after this activity that only a good question can elicit a good response."

The corresponding ggplot2 R codes will also be provided once a plot has been created. Additionally, another shiny app called ggpaintr_iris_app is included in the package to showcase how to deploy the basic functionality of this package to build other shiny apps or packages."

However, since it is an estimation tool, its accuracy ic not guaranteed. We developed a set of tests so that we can do the post selection inference on the estimation from PMD. In this package TestPMD, we focus on sparse canonical correlation analysis using PMD. This package provides functions for estimation, test of canonical correlations, test of the canonical loadings, visualization using scatter plot, bar plot and fisher exact test for group enrichment analysis. Users can therefore decide the dimension used for downstream analysis, which feature truly contributes to the canonical component and how these results relate to the covariates. For some statisticians, it is not easy to gain biological insights from the identified features due to the complex name of molecules. So, we provide a search tool which can be used to pull the top 5 papers from PubMed by searching the feature names. A shiny app is created to facilitate the use of TestPMD."

The wealth of information provided with online reviews can be analyzed to access the general sentiment of the consumer towards the product/service. This sentiment analysis will provide general idea and quantitative measure of the consumer’s sentiment.\nThe required data set, in .tsv format, consist of a text review and a binary input of 0 or 1 indicating whether the consumer liked the item or not. These will be balanced using “ROSE” package, which attempts to generate synthetic data by randomly over-sampling examples in case of imbalance data.\nThen using a text mining package “tm”, it will mine for the words/word base of interest such as keywords that conveys sentiment based on dictionary list provided by the package. This “stream-lined” tokens that were independent variables on the raw dataset is then joined in a matrix through either of the three algorithms of the user’s choice such as Bag of Words, Tfdfi, or Bigram and will be analyzed based on its sentiment. Next, using “caTools” package, we split the data set to 0.2 data and 0.8 training set split ratio to be fed to different classification models of provided by the existing machine learning algorithms training models.\nThe package also compares the accuracy of the prediction model based on the machine learning algorithm which the user can choose from: decision tree, naïve bayes, or random forest. The result is different parameters of the sentiment prediction that is built in a confusion matrix: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score. Lastly, these parameters will be visualized as a wordcloud as well as presented in an interactive Shiny app. Overall, this package will put together different algorithms and visualization of a version of natural language processing (NLP) and will allow a broader audience of user to access this tool."

Package uses pkgdown to present documentation to the reader.\nMost functions are well documented, but gaps in examples or full documentation exist. Documentation on pkgdown exists, but may have some deficiencies or be slightly out of date.\nSome functions are documented, but large gaps in documentation and examples exist, making it difficult to understand how to use the package functions. Package documentation may exist, but pkgdown is not used to make the documentation easily available on the web.\nThe package is poorly documented, or existing documentation is not easy to read and understand. No attempt to use pkgdown to make documentation available online.\n\n\nTesting\n5\nPackage has over 90% test coverage with meaningful tests. Functions are structured to do only one thing to make testing efficient. Package integrated with TravisCI and Codecov.io, and test coverage and status are reported in the package README.\nPackage has over 80% test coverage. Tests cover some important functionality but unnecessary tests exist and/or tests miss important areas of coverage. Functions may not be written to perform only one task. Travis integration and Codecov.io integration are set up but may not be working consistently.\nPackage has less than 80% test coverage with meaningful tests. Functions are not well structured for testing. Travis CI or Codecov.io integration is not working.\nPackage has minimal or no useful testing. No attempt to make use of Travis CI or Codecov.io to show package testing status.\n\n\nPackage Data\n5\nPackage includes some data which is useful for demonstrating the package functions. Data is well documented and used in the examples and the package vignette.\nPackage includes data used to demonstrate the package, but documentation is lacking and/or the data is not integrated into examples and the package vignette. Package may include some data which is not properly documented or necessary to the package’s functions\nPackage includes data but it is not well documented. Examples and vignettes may use data which is not included in the package and is also not explained or documented well.\nPackage does not include data or includes data with no documentation or explanation\n\n\nSpelling\n5\nPackage and documentation is spell-checked\nSome spelling errors are present but writing is mostly coherent\nPackage documentation and function comments have noticable lapses in spelling and/or grammar.\nPackage documentation is poorly spell-checked, has incomprehensible grammar, or is non-existent\n\n\nDependencies/Imports\n3\nPackage has dependencies and imports that make sense\nPackage has a few extra imported packages, or packages which are listed as dependencies that could be imported instead\nPackage is missing imports or dependencies\nNo attempt has been made to list imports and dependencies in a coherent fashion\n\n\nExported functions\n2\nOnly functions which are intended to be shown to the user are exported; all exported functions have examples and supporting documentation\nSome attention has been given to only exporting functions intended for user use, but there are some issues with the implementation\nAll functions are exported, or functions that are intended for user use have not been exported\nNo attention has been paid to which functions should be imported or exported\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny App (30 Points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nPoints\nOutstanding (> 90%)\nGood (70-90%)\nNeeds work (50-70%)\nNeeds a lot of work (< 50%)\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n10\nInstallation instructions are complete, shinyApp loads and runs without problems\nminor things have to be taken care of before the app runs or installation instructions are missing crucial information\nminor things have to be taken care of before the app runs and installation instructions are missing crucial information\nmajor steps need to be taken to ensure that the app runs, installation instructions are missing or not helpful\n\n\nFunctionality\n10\nThe shiny app provides access to an important piece of the package and works smoothly.\nThe app demonstrates a minor aspect of the package. The app stops working intermittently.\n\n\n\n\nComplexity\n10\nMultiple interactive UI elements are implemented\n\n\nThe app is quite simplistic.\n\n\n\n\n\nVignette (30 Points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\nPoints\nOutstanding (> 90%)\nGood (70-90%)\nNeeds work (50-70%)\nNeeds a lot of work (< 50%)\n\n\n\n\nUses pkgdown and github /docs\n8\nReport is formatted as a vignette using pkgdown and integrated into the github repository using the /docs folder.\nReport can be generated reproducibly and is located in the /docs folder, but does not use pkgdown or is not connected to the package’s github.io site\nReport is not reproducible or not located in the correct location\nReport consists of loosely connected pieces\n\n\nContent\n7\nReport describes the use of the package and package functions, unifying the separate functions included in the package to solve a single problem or task. Each major function is included in the vignette, with substantial additional text explaining the use of the function to solve a real-world problem.\nReport describes the use of the package and package functions, but does not present the package as a unified entity aimed at a specific single task. Some descriptions are sparse; the vignette may leave the reader with additional questions that are not completely answered. Code examples may only cover specific use cases instead of a more general approach\nVignette does not include all major functions, examples do not demonstrate major package functionality, and additional textual descriptions may be sparse or absent in places.\nVignette does not demonstrate major package functionality, and only includes minimal text description of the package’s capabilities.\n\n\nGraphs and Tables\n10\nGraphs and tables included in the package vignette are designed for a specific purpose and are carefully constructed to communicate with the reader. Each graph or table illustrates one point or package feature. Formatting and styling show that some optimization and care went into the creation of the table or graph\nGraphs and tables are well constructed but may have minor flaws or poor labeling decisions.\nMany graphs or tables have minor problems, or may be poorly chosen or redundant.\nGraphs and tables do not support questions and findings. Major problems with presentation - graphs may be missing or fail to generate.\n\n\nText\n5\nEnglish is polished, concise, and clear. No grammar or spelling mistakes\nClear and concise, but not elegant. Some spelling/grammar errors\nReadable, but unnecessarily verbose or lacking in detail. Many errors that compromise readability.\nBarely readable, with many spelling and grammar errors. No evidence of any proof-reading."

As statisticians we cannot always rely on other people and sciences to get the data into formats that we can deal with: we will discuss aspects of statistical computing as they are relevant for data analysis. Read and work with data in different formats: flat files, databases, web technologies. Elements of literate programming help us with making our workflow transparent and analyses reproducible. We will discuss communication of results in form of R packages and interactive web applications."
