And users can write and provide their own modules to further extend and customize the package’s functionality. A shiny app called ggpaintr_app is built with the ggpaintr package and included in the package. ggpaintr_app serves as a shiny app for those unfamiliar with the Grammar of Graphics or ggplot2 but want to create a plot using ggplot2. The corresponding ggplot2 R codes will also be provided once a plot has been created. Additionally, another shiny app called ggpaintr_iris_app is included in the package to showcase how to deploy the basic functionality of this package to build other shiny apps or packages."

However, since it is an estimation tool, its accuracy ic not guaranteed. We developed a set of tests so that we can do the post selection inference on the estimation from PMD. In this package TestPMD, we focus on sparse canonical correlation analysis using PMD. This package provides functions for estimation, test of canonical correlations, test of the canonical loadings, visualization using scatter plot, bar plot and fisher exact test for group enrichment analysis. Users can therefore decide the dimension used for downstream analysis, which feature truly contributes to the canonical component and how these results relate to the covariates. For some statisticians, it is not easy to gain biological insights from the identified features due to the complex name of molecules. So, we provide a search tool which can be used to pull the top 5 papers from PubMed by searching the feature names. A shiny app is created to facilitate the use of TestPMD."

The wealth of information provided with online reviews can be analyzed to access the general sentiment of the consumer towards the product/service. This sentiment analysis will provide general idea and quantitative measure of the consumer’s sentiment.\nThe required data set, in .tsv format, consist of a text review and a binary input of 0 or 1 indicating whether the consumer liked the item or not. These will be balanced using “ROSE” package, which attempts to generate synthetic data by randomly over-sampling examples in case of imbalance data.\nThen using a text mining package “tm”, it will mine for the words/word base of interest such as keywords that conveys sentiment based on dictionary list provided by the package. This “stream-lined” tokens that were independent variables on the raw dataset is then joined in a matrix through either of the three algorithms of the user’s choice such as Bag of Words, Tfdfi, or Bigram and will be analyzed based on its sentiment. Next, using “caTools” package, we split the data set to 0.2 data and 0.8 training set split ratio to be fed to different classification models of provided by the existing machine learning algorithms training models.\nThe package also compares the accuracy of the prediction model based on the machine learning algorithm which the user can choose from: decision tree, naïve bayes, or random forest. The result is different parameters of the sentiment prediction that is built in a confusion matrix: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 score. Lastly, these parameters will be visualized as a wordcloud as well as presented in an interactive Shiny app. Overall, this package will put together different algorithms and visualization of a version of natural language processing (NLP) and will allow a broader audience of user to access this tool."

Our project (R package) allows us to scrape information from Skyscanner API, and keep track of that per unit time. The functions in our package also enable us to filter and sort the available flights based on customized constraints. Outcomes are presented with both text and user-friendly figures.

    "text": "Blog Post - Landon Getting\nWhile trying to identify a question to answer, I was surprised at the rate of response to most of the posted questions on StackOverflow. Many of the trivial, popular, or generic questions were answered in around 20 minutes. By the time I was done crafting my response, there had already been an accepted answer. However, I went back a few days and found an interesting unanswered question. I answered “How to plot the effects of various explanatory variables on the response variable” on StackOverflow.\nPlotting data in many dimensions can be a difficult task and it made sense why this question was unanswered. In my limited experience, there is not a widely accepted and general method for this type of visual. I did some ‘search and research’ as suggested in “How do I ask a good question?” and came up wanting more - as the author of the question likely did. I think the author could have been more precise with their title. Something along the lines of “Plotting Effect of Predictors in MLR on Response Variable?” However, the post was overall short and to the point. I also would have liked to see some data provided to help generate examples. I created a quick shiny app to show how an interactive solution may be useful in addition to a simple column graph for relative comparison of the effects."

As a result, I was able to test out similar code myself with a sample program to determine whether my solution was plausible. Additionally, I was able to compare my solution with related questions and answers presented by other StackOverflow users. However, the asker did not provide the specific R package they used to fit their model. Hence, I was unable to know for sure whether the issue was related to the data in their test matrix or if it was instead an issue with the way they were using a certain package. The question only included small amounts of code and a brief description of the issue. Additionally, no comments were included for the code that was included, which made it difficult to understand all lines of code with this package that I was seemingly unfamiliar with. Fortunately, the problem appeared to be quite self-explanatory and required few additional details. When answering the question, I asked for additional clarification on the R package that they used so that myself or another user can provide a more detailed solution (if my solution does not solve their issue). The problem should then be easily solved by another user who has a greater degree of familiarity with the associated package.\n\nInstructions to follow."

Like, I’m not sure if the user looked elsewhere before asking on StackOverflow. Simply Googling “How to remove the numbering before a section in LaTeX” pulls up an Overleaf site with the answer. So if I were that person, I would have first looked elsewhere.\nThe question asker also could have done a little better with include all relevant code in order to answer their solution. They included just the part that was giving them trouble, when a document class and some of the packages being used would have been helpful. I assumed they were working on an article as it is the most common, but the answer should apply across all classes.\nIf I could talk to them face-to-face, I would have pointed them to other sources (i.e. Overleaf) for most of their questions, since their documentation is really good for quick-access LaTeX questions. If they were also working in somehting like R with a Quarto document, I know Quarto’s website also has a plethora of knowledge.\nOne thing the readings did not tell you is that answering on StackOverflow is SO SCARY like I haven’t been as stressed out about anything before. Like, what is too little to add? Is saying that `{python} ` (without the space) is another way to quickly access Python in a .Rmd document, when someone already spoke about the code you can run in a R session with the ‘reticulate’ package? Also I was and still am afraid that I made a mistake with my answer and it is wrong or not what they needed and then my answer will get down-voted to the deepest depths.\nI’m just too timid to ask questions on StackOverflow, but also too timid to answer them.\n\n\nInstructions to follow."

Which seems like a good system for preventing the new fake/spam accounts. Stackoverflow seems like a helpful community to ask questions. There were other highly active questions which I was not allowed to answer due to similar reason as having a low reputation.\nThe second question I answered was on python as we discussed in the class.

As chapter 10 may have been the starting place, suggesting Chapter 15 was at an attempt to allow the user to understand more about the UI being reactive when changed.

As a result, it would be hard to make the best recommendation. - We don’t know what the data look like"

While the inquirer added some example code about what data they were working with, they didn’t elaborate on the outcome that was expected of the corrected code. For this reason, another user and myself had to assume what the intended output had to be.

Then, I located the question that I answered above which is a relatively easy question. By reading the title of this question, I could easily get what they want to know, and based on my knowledge of R and ggplot2 package, it is easy for me to come up with an illustration that used ggplot() and geom_line() to plot multiple lines in the same plot. After I finished my solution, I came back to the stackoverflow page and read through others’ solutions. It turned out that there are many different ways of drawing two graphs in the same plot that I have not used before.

It was very helpful that the OP provided their code with the question. However, the OP’s code used a dataset that was not built into R and the OP did not include code to create the dataset for the plot. This broke one of the guidelines for minimal reproducible examples. Fortunately, the requested plot was simple enough that I could recreate the issue using the built-in iris dataset in R. The problem turned out to be that the OP wanted to use the fill aesthetic to change the color of the bars on the plot via scale_fill_manual but did not have anything mapped to the fill aesthetic. In my answer, I provided an example very similar to the OP’s code, except I used the iris dataset with the variable Species mapped to the x aesthetic to define the bars and also mapped Species to the fill aesthetic so I could use scale_fill_manual to change the colors of the bars."

When I had answered this question, I was not aware of the correct way to ask questions. Based on the readings, the question asked meets the first criterion for a good question, which is that the question should be on topic and suitable to the Stackoverflow website.The portal Stackoverflow invites questions about programming and the question asked met this requirement. The second requirement is to research and search the existing set of questions to ensure that the question you intend to ask is not duplicated. Although the questioner (which, in this case, was me) had researched and searched the existing set of questions to look for a suitable answer, there is no proof provided to indicate that the question was not repeated/duplicated. The questioner had not linked any seemingly similar questions on this topic existing on the portal. It could also be that there were no such questions. Thereafter, another requirement is that the title of the question summarizes the specific problem faced by the researcher. This condition is not met by the questioner as the title could appear a vague and ambiguous to those attempting to answer the question, although the question itself carries some details, if not all. This is why the person attempting to answer this question asked counterquestions for further clarification. While offering clarification to the question, I stumbled upon the answer myself and answered it on the portal as user13073332. With this experience of asking and answering questions, I learned the importance of providing all possible details required to answer the questions satisfactorily. A question that is clear begets answers whereas one that is unclear only invites further questions. I would also like to link another question I had answered on R help. In this case, the questioner was not me but I had provided the answer under the name “Sudi”.\nThe title of the question is not clear to the extent that there is no indication that it may be a question related to R as required by the guidelines of the portal. However, the person asking the question provides all the required information as part of the question, albeit leaving room for grammatical correction. No vignettes or code demonstrations were provided. The questioner did not allude to other similar questions on the portal or their search about such questions. As I was the second person answering this question, I had help in the form of the answer from the person who had attempted the question before me. Their answer had code information, which was useful while providing an answer.\n\nInstructions to follow."

They go on to say “Any package I try to install raises the same issue,” which cannot be true since the error message is specific to the package and its dependencies. As such, I’m not sure if their question was helpful to resolving their issue, since there seemed to issues with not having admin rights that was complicating the installation process.

I read chapter 9 about the person access tokens for HTTPS. GitHub requires a personal access token so that they know the person who is trying to make changes is the correct user. The password we use to login is not sufficient to verify credentials which is why we need this specific personal access token. All you have to do is generate a token and then enter it when you set up credentials. You can set a time for expiration, and once the token expires you have to regenerate a new one. This chapter also details the difference between HTTPS and SSH. HTTPS is strongly recommended over SSH because it is easier to work with and can be used with GitHub’s API which is called in some R packages.\nLooking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How? A big problem working on a group project is sharing code. Often we can split up the work so we don’t need to share code, but if we do we often email files back and forth which can be tedious and sometimes not the most up to date. Using GitHub would solve this problem and branching could ensure we can work parallelly.\nGive an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan’s book.

Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.\nMy answers:\n\nWhile I learned new things from all the chapters I had an interest in checking, I especially found the “Resetting” chapter to be resourceful. Simply, there are three methods for resetting a commit. The git reset ---hard HEAD^ will undo everything, losing all changes. The git reset HEAD^ will only undo the commit and clear the stage but your files stay the same. Finally git reset --soft HEAD^ will undo the commit and restore the staged changes. If the intention is to change the earlier message, there is also a possibility to amend recent commit messages by using git commit --amend -m \"New commit message\". Resetting is an important component to commit’s because we all make committing mistakes in our projects and these offer an alternative to “burning it all down.”\nI think the biggest mishap has always been not taking enough time to properly design the workflow that we wanted to use as a team. We would have one directory in Box, another in Github and people would start using their own local files for work without committing and since some branched and others didn’t, Git would have a difficult time understanding our project. An effort I want to make moving forward is really detailing exactly how we want to move forward with workflow and incorporating everyone’s ideas on workflow flexibility as projects evolves.\nI did not know about the --amend command. I also only recently learned about the different reset options after I made mistakes to a repository that I burned down (but didn’t have to had I known about these commands ahead of time)."

However, if the instructor required that the project used a GitHub repo to save work/progress (and would check commits on the repo), perhaps the non-contributing member would have felt more pressure to contribute to the repo. In all but one of the code-heavy projects, we did use GitHub to save our work (though it wasn’t available to instructor) and for non-code stuff we used Google docs, so we didn’t face other direct problems that would’ve been solved by git.\n\nGive an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan’s book..\n\nI learned a new workflow https://happygitwithr.com/repeated-amend.html.

    "text": "Chapter 27: The Repeated Amend: Ian Parzyszek 1)\nIn this chapter we focused on situations where you are making continual changes and updates to a project, but you don’t want to continually have a lot of commits. This could look sloppy and not as useful. However, you also do not want to have very few commits and not have a lot to fall back on. They gave an example of a rock climber and you want to have enough ankers to protect you, but too many can slow you down. They introduced the idea of adding the idea of “WIP” amendments. This is used when you made some changes and you may be in the middle of something and it will signal to other people that more commits may be coming. It seemed to me that ideally you want to have “WIP” comments which denotes that these changes only exist in your local repo, yet on git. Then you can continue to finish what you are working on. And on your end you may see a history that looks like this: A – B –C – WIP–D But once you finish what you have done push it only once you have finished D…then your repository commit history will look like this: A—B—C—D (much nicer) The Chapter went on to talk about what if you did push this intermediate step of WIP what do you do? Should you go back and change it so it looks nicer, should you not? And it all depends on the collaborators you have and if you believe that may have pulled from Git.\n\nThe biggest mishap I have had in a group project (that maybe git could be useful) was probably when two people were working together in the same room on part of the project and someone else was working remotely. What had happened was we were both making changes to the same part of the project at the same time, but didn’t know about it then when we came back together we found out that now we have to find a way to bring everything together again. I think maybe git could have been used in a way that it could have found a way to merge to two versions together and we could find a way to pick and choose which sections we would keep. I know we said we would learn about this soon, so I’m not exactly sure how this works in git, but I imagine it could be helpful.\n\n3). I don’t think this is necessarily a feature of git itself but rather an understanding that git users have, and that is the “WIP” commit message. Which can be extremely usefully whenever you are working with a group. If you accidently push something it lets your group know that you are in the middle of something and it is not yet to finalized or have a functional project yet. And it is also useful so that you yourself won’t have bunch of cluttered commits in your history."

Creating a GitHub account is covered in the fourth chapter. I already had a little basic knowledge of Git and GitHub, but I’m always looking to learn more. Everyone can register at GitHub for free from here. I discovered that a GitHub username should:\n\nInclude real name and be original, brief, and simple to read.\nnot be tied to time, the school’s name, etc.\nnot include uppercase and lowercase letters, use hyphens to separate words.\nbe a good username while you can modify your username anytime later.\n\nGitHub provides unlimited free private repositories with a maximum of three external collaborators. If you are an academic member, educational/research staff member, or student, you can also take advantage of GitHub Education. formally recognized charities and nonprofits can benefit from GitHub for Good. You must purchase plans with a number of advanced features if you require private repositories with more than three external collaborators.Current plans and pricing information is available here.\n\nLooking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?.\n\nMost of the time, in our team projects, we face challenges that can be avoided by using GitHub. For example, in a team project I am currently working on, we upload our updated presentations in a shared Box folder. We created different sub folders for different collaborators, and each member should upload her/ his files in a specific folder mentioning its date and time. Now all of these files can be uploaded to a private repository, and everyone in the team can see changes with their related date and time and the member who made those changes. In this way, every document can be accessible easier for all the team members, and later, the team can make this repository public if possible, and others can also use the information you found and not reinvent the wheel.\n\nGive an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan’s book..\n\nI could not read all the chapters from the book, but it is very interesting that I found that GitHub can be connected with Rstudio. We can easily use these two for our projects. Regarding chapter 15 in the book, it seems that we can make changes in R studio and then commit the changes to the local repository, and then we can push our local changes to GitHub."

To have RStudio and GitHub communicate with each other, you should start with a new repository on GitHub that is initialized with a README. Then you need to copy a link to the GitHub repository, either HTTPS or SSH (whichever you prefer). Once everything is set up in GitHub, you move to RStudio and create a new project with version control. Then you paste the URL for your GitHub repository into the “Repository URL” box in RStudio and finish the project creation process. Assuming everything went smoothly, you should be able to see the README.md file from GitHub in your RStudio project. To further make sure everything is set up correctly, you can change the README.md file in RStudio, commit the changes, and push them to GitHub. If the changes appear in GitHub online, you’re good to go!\n\nLooking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?.\n\nI have experienced a common inconvenience in several group projects and group homework assignments in my graduate statistics classes. The assignments usually involved writing a report or showing our work and including R code. If there hadn’t been the requirement to include R code, we probably would have used a collaboration tool like Overleaf to write the report. Since we also had to include working R code, this meant the groups preferred to work with RMarkdown files. After deciding which group member would type each question, we would each work on our own individual RMarkdown file, send them to each other when we were finished with our work, and then copy and paste everyone’s work into one file for submission. Using git would have been a lot easier because all group members could have been able to see each other’s work sooner. Combining the work into one file also would have been much simpler with git.\n\nGive an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan’s book.. I learned that you can connect RStudio to GitHub using HTTPS instead of SSH. When I last worked with RStudio and GitHub together (a few years ago), I thought you could only connect the two using SSH. The HTTPS method seems much easier."

Although she does not mean actual time travel, she describes a particularly useful feature of Git: the ability too look at previous versions of one’s code. There a multiple instances in which this would be useful. For instance, one might want to refer back to the color scheme used in one of the previous drafts of a manuscript; or worse, one might have to convert their barplot to a boxplot after arguing with their advisor that the boxplot was the better option from the beginning. In summary, regardless of why one would have to refer back to previous version of their code, Git facilitates this process."

For the best experience, it’s recommended to be on 4.something in R at this point. Keep at least one minor version up-to-date. Two minor versions behind will cause you problems as CRAN no longer supports pre-built binary add-on packages. Preview releases are similar to general releases, but they are used as release candidates in the build-up to new general releases. Preview version includes new features, but it is also very stable and highly usable. RStudio updates much more frequently than R itself. RStudio requires monthly updates, while R requires annual updates.\n\nLooking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?. My last project was an interdisciplinary project in collaboration with chemical engineers, and we worked more often asynchronously than synchronously. When it comes to collaborating with distributed teams on projects, there are many challenges that must be overcome. The majority of the time I was unaware of their current changes in their experimental results, which had an effect on my results and added to my workload, as I had to go back and forth all the time to observe what they were doing. It is likely that GitHub could make this process much simpler in many ways, as it could track changes and go back to previous versions of a project, which would make the collaboration much easier.\nGive an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan’s book.. I Learn more about branches in this book. With Git, users have the option of working on a line that runs parallel to the main files of the project. Branch is the term used to describe these lines. As a feature of Git, branches provide a way for developers to modify the project without having to make any changes to the original version of the code. Whenever a version is being developed, a production quality branch of the code will always be present in the master branch. On the branches, you can test and work on any new features you will be launching and then you can merge them with the main branch as soon as they are ready. With the help of a few Git commands, branching and merging can be done very quickly and easily. There is a possibility that one version of a project may contain a number of different branches as per the requirements of the user."

Git works with this concept seamlessly allowing for branches to open and merge back quickly. One can create their own branch, switch between branches, and merge a branch with only a line of code. This chapter also explains how to deal with possible issue that may occur and recognizes that a conflict does not mean a disaster (this is often why we use branches… to avoid disaster). One of the main reasons for branching is to allow for brainstorming, consideration, and implementing new ideas… this is how progress is made.\n\nLooking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?.\n\nThrough majority of the team projects that I have been involved in, the largest mishap occurs from ‘stepping on each others toes’… When working in a group where everyone wants to be able to get something accomplished to achieve the best possible outcome, it can be subjective to each individual. When working on PowerPoint slides or writing a report; people tend to have differences in opinions on what the best layout is or the best wording for certain sentences. This is where I have found the greatest conflict because it becomes difficult if we are all working on the same document to change things without the work of others getting loss in the process and work may get lost. This problem could possibly be able to be avoided using git as it has its own system for backing up previous work, seeing who made changes, and when they were made.\n\nGive an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan’s book..\n\nI have not read Jenny Bryan’s book previously and found it to be a great resource. Though I knew the general basics of git, I appreciated that the book walked through the processes of learning git and showed it truly as a processes and that confusion is okay and expected. Because of this I learned more about possible errors that could occur throughout the merging process and how to tackle them if they present themselves as issues. I also learned through this book that it is better to start a new project on GitHub first prior to working in a new project in R."

Have a look over the index and pick one of the chapters for a more in-depth read.\nWrite a blog post answering the following questions:\n\nWrite a short (100-150 words) summary of the chapter you read in-depth. Question 1: (I read the chapter 22, “Branches”)\n\nMy answer: Basically, branching is used to take a detour from the main stream to work on the code without making any instant changes to the source file. This characteristic lets people work at the same time on the project without any conflicts or errors. To use this feature, we should create a new branch. One person may or may not create multiple branches; in this case, the person can use “git checkout” to switch between the branches. One important point is that when we switch to another branch while we are not done with the other branch(es), we should commit the in progress branch temporarily. When we want to resume working on the incomplete branch, we should reset the target branch. It worth to mention that there are different type of resetting such as soft, hard, and mixed that help resetting back to different past stages of the interest. Finally, we can merge the complete branch. If we want to merge more than one branches, it is possible to see the conflict message if we have changed the same part in the both branches. In this situation, we can get the status and check the conflict easily. Also, we always can go back to the previous stages of the branch to check and do the revisions accordingly. 2. Looking back at all of the team projects you have been involved in, describe the biggest mishap you had. Could that have been avoided using git? How?. Question 2: My answer: I think one of the biggest challenge that I experienced during my Ph.D. in team working was that we had to work individually on our ideas and we could not document everyone’s work properly. Also, we did not access to each others works while we were working. Another problem was in the review process of each others work; if one might change something based on another person’s feedback, the change was not tracked easily. The advantage of working with fit is that everyone work in one repository, save everything in one location, always accessible for other team members, easy to review other people’s work, easy to track changes. 3. Give an example of one new git feature that you learned about from Jenny Bryan’s book..\nQuestion 3: My answer: I found the branch option very useful for collaborations! suppose our team is working on a competition which is a classification problem. There is a source code that applied a random forest model and got an average classification performance. Now, I guess that I can improve the model by tuning the hyper parameters with either Bayesian optimization or grid search. I can easily create two branches; one for examination of Bayesian optimization, another for implementation of the grid search. In this case, I can work on the two ideas separately without any changes in the source file, test the both ideas, pick the best one, and merge the final version."
