## Course description:
Not all data lives in nice, clean spreadsheets, not all data fits in a computer's main memory. As statisticians we cannot always rely on other people and sciences to get the data into formats that we can deal with: we will discuss aspects of statistical computing as they are relevant for data analysis. Read and work with data in different formats: flat files, databases, web technologies. Elements of literate programming help us with making our workflow transparent and analyses reproducible. We will discuss communication of results in form of R packages and interactive web applications.


## Learn how to...
- read and combine data from flat files, SQL database, binary netCDF, and making use of web technologies as data source.
- compute with data.
- clean the data, check the quality, impute missing values.
- write efficient and reproducible code so others are able to replicate the analysis.
- develop software, individually and collaboratively, debug, profile and package R code.
- experiment with event driven programming to build an interactive graphic, and a GUI.
- pull data together to solve a contemporary problem.
